Additional Components
=====================

.. _axonivyportal.components.additionalcomponent.processhistory:

Process history
---------------

.. _axonivyportal.components.additionalcomponent.processhistory.introduction:

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This component is a lazy loading list which displays all business cases
of a business entity in your application. You can include this component
everywhere:

In a page

|image0|

In a dialog

|image1|

.. _axonivyportal.components.additionalcomponent.processhistory.howtouse:

How to use
~~~~~~~~~~

First you need to link the cases to the business entity. Call the
subprocess ``SetBusinessEntityId`` in the process which need to be
linked and input an identifier unique to your business entity. The
subprocess will set the id to the additional property
"CASE_BUSINESS_ENTITY_PROPERTY" of the business case.

|image2|

Include the process history component into your page:

``<ic:ch.ivy.addon.portal.component.ProcessHistory businessEntityId="resourceA247" >``

The value of the attribute ``businessEntityId`` must match the id input
into the subprocess in the first step.

By default the component will load 20 cases at a time. You can change
this by setting the attribute ``chunkSize`` to the number you want . You
should use this attribute alongside with the attribute ``scrollHeight``
to configure the scroll bar of the list.

   **Note**

   If you use this component in a dialog, you must run this script
   processHistory.setup();
   when the dialog is shown. For example:
   ``<p:dialog widgetVar="process-history-dialog" id="process-history-dialog" width="800" height="500"
                           header="Process history of Resource A247" onShow="processHistory.setup();">``

   ``<ic:ch.ivy.addon.portal.component.ProcessHistory businessEntityId="resourceA247"
                           chunkSize="6"
                           scrollHeight="400" />``

   ``</p:dialog>``

..

   **Important**

   If your process has a Trigger component or sends a signal to start
   another process with the option "Attach to Business Case that
   triggered this process" selected, the current case of the process
   will become a technical case and will not be loaded into the process
   history list. In this case You need to call the
   SetBusinessEntityId
   subprocess after the first Trigger or signal sending step.

key to flash object with any value

   flash.put("overridePortalGrowl", true);
   flash.setRedirect(true);

It's enough if you want to turn it off. To override the message, add
``facesMessage`` to this component

::

   import javax.faces.context.Flash;
   import javax.faces.context.FacesContext;
   import javax.faces.application.FacesMessage;

   FacesMessage message = new FacesMessage("Task is done successfully");
   FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().addMessage("portal-global-growl-message", message);

   Flash flash = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getFlash();
   flash.put("overridePortalGrowl", true);
   flash.setRedirect(true);
   flash.setKeepMessages(true);
