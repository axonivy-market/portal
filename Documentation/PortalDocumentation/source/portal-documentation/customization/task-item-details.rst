How to custom Task item details UI
----------------------------------

Refer to ``PortalExamples`` project for examples.

1. Introduce an Axon.ivy project which has ``PortalTemplate`` as a
   required library.

2. To customize task item detail, you must customize Portal Home first.
   Refer to :ref:`Customize Portal
   home <customization-portal-home>` to set new home
   page.

3. Copy the ``PortalStart`` process from ``PortalTemplate`` to your
   project. Point PortalHome element to your custom home page in
   previous step. This process is new home page and administrator should
   register this link by Portal's Admin Settings.

4. Custom the Task item details:

   -  Introduce a new HTMLDialog which uses template
      ``/layouts/PortalTaskDetailsTemplate.xhtml``. You can take a look
      at ``PortalTaskDetails.xhtml`` to see how to customize it.

         .. tip:: Highly recommend to copy the ``PortalTaskDetails`` HTMLDialog
               in PortalTemplate. Remove ``ui:remove`` and change the copied
               one's view.

   -  Use Axon.ivy Override to override the ``OpenPortalTaskDetail``  callable. The original implementation of this
      callable is calling  ``PortalTaskDetails`` , change it to call the customized
      Page introduced in the step above. The signature of this callable is ``call(ITask)``  and customized page must receive this  ``ITask``  instance, put in
      the dialog's  ``Data``  with the exact name  ``taskData``  .

5. After previous steps, you can override Task item details UI elements
   as shown/hidden element by keywords:

   To show/hide, please using ``showItemDetailsHeader``,
   ``showItemDetailsNotes``, ``showItemDetailDocuments`` code. For more
   details, please refer to :ref:`Show/Hide
   components <customization-task-item-details-how-to-overide-ui-show-hidden-ui>`.

   And to add a new elements, please refer to  :ref:`Add new Custom
   panel <customization-task-item-details-how-to-overide-ui-custom-body>`
   code

Show/Hide components by keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the ``ui`` tag list in ``PortalTaskDetails.xhtml`` of
PortalTemplate. In case, we want to show/hide any elements on
TaskItemDetails, we should override value of ``ui:param``

List valid parameters:

-  ``ui:param name="showItemDetailsHeader" value="true"``

   To show/hide Task header, by default it's true.

-  ``ui:param name="showItemDetailsNotes" value="true">``

   To show/hide Task Notes component, by default it's true.

-  ``ui:param name="showItemDetailDocuments" value="true"``

   To show/hide Task Documents component, by default it's true.

.. _customization-task-item-details-how-to-overide-ui-custom-body:

Add new Custom panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the ``taskItemDetailCustomPanel*`` section in
``PortalTaskDetails.xhtml`` of PortalTemplate.

-  We need to define the ``ui:define`` with the valid name such as
   ``taskItemDetailCustomPanelTop`` and
   ``taskItemDetailCustomPanelBottom``.

   The ``taskItemDetailCustomPanelTop``: will be shown on the top of the
   component

   The ``taskItemDetailCustomPanelBottom``: will be shown on the bottom
   of the component

-  Add your custom code into that tag

-  Finally, your custom panel will be displayed inside of
   :ref:`TaskItemDetails <customization-task-item-details>`
   page

   |custom-panel-example-code|

-  After applied above code to your custom page, the custom panel will
   display as below

   |custom-panel-override|
