.. _installation:

Installation
************

The installation section describes all the steps, that are necessary to
install and setup Portal.

If you install the application for the first time than it's important to start
with the `Basic installation`_ . It describes all the initial steps, that must
be done for the first installation.

If the application is already installed and initial prepared, than refer
to `Migration notes`_ to migrate the application.

Basic installation
==================

Project modules
---------------

The application consists of 4 process modules. For detailed information
of each module, refer to :ref:`architecture` .

-  PortalStyle

-  PortalKit

-  PortalTemplate

-  AxonIvyExpress

The project deployment of Ivy project are described in `project
deployment <http://developer.axonivy.com/doc/latest/EngineGuideHtml/administration.html#administration-deployment>`__
.

.. _installation-basic-portal-mode:

Portal mode
-----------

-  **Single mode**  : One Portal application on one engine. It must include PortalKit,
   PortalTemplate and PortalStyle modules.

-  **Multi applications mode** : Multiple Portal applications on one engine.
   Each Portal application must include PortalKit, PortalTemplate and PortalStyle modules.

.. important::
   In multi applications mode, if you need overall dashboard, create
   an application named **Portal** with the Portal modules.

Installation
------------

Designer
^^^^^^^^

Import Portal modules to Designer. This is Single mode.

Engine without license (demo mode)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The engine automatically deploys the Portal application with default users. You do
not need to deploy anything. This is Single mode.

.. table:: 

   +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
   | Username              | Password              | Description           |

   +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+


Engine with license (production mode)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The engine does not deploy anything, you need to deploy and configure Portal application 
manually.

Single mode
"""""""""""

Create an application and deploy Portal modules.

.. important::

   Only one active application contains Portal modules, no more.

Multi applications mode
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Refer :ref:`settings-admin-settings-setup-multi-portals`.

.. _installation-migration-notes:

Migration notes
===============

This document informs you in detail about incompatibilities that were
introduced between Portal versions and tells you what needs to be done
to make your existing Portal working with current Axon.ivy engine.

How to migrate
--------------
   
.. important:: 
   If you call any Portal API which is not mentioned in document. It
   could be changed or removed. Re-implement it in your own project.

   In order to migrate Portal, you need to migrate Axon.ivy, refer
   `Axon.ivy migration
   notes <https://developer.axonivy.com/doc/latest/MigrationNotes.html>`__.
   Changes in Axon.ivy could lead to problems if customer project is not
   migrated properly.

In designer
-----------

1. Replace all Portal projects
2. Update PortalTemplate dependency of customer project in pom.xml.
3. If PortalStyle is customized, copy logo, customization.scss,
   font-faces.scss, customized stuff from old to new PortalStyle, run
   maven to compile CSS.
4. Follow migration notes.
5. If customization needs copying code from Portal, merge changes
   between 2 version of Portal for copied code.

..

.. important::
   -  Scenario migrating one customer project without customization:
      Follow guidelines to step 2.
   -  Scenario migrating one customer project with supported
      customization: Follow the guidelines.
   -  Scenario migrating one customer project with (un)supported
      customization: Follow guidelines for supported customization. If
      unsupported customization needs copying code from Portal, merge
      changes between 2 versions of Portal for copied code. Take care
      your own unsupported customization.

In engine
---------

1. Convert database schema if needed.
2. If your ivy version is before 7.3.0 : deactivate standard Portal
   application if it's not needed.
3. Redeploy Portal projects (exclude PortalConnector) and customer
   project.
4. Follow migration notes to migrate data, if any.

.. _installation-migration-notes-8-0-0:

Migrate to 8.0.0
----------------


From Portal version 8.0.0, we use the Serenity theme as the default
style for project. If your project is using ``LESS`` languages for
customizing style, you should convert them to a new format as ``SASS``. 

How to convert `LESS <http://lesscss.org>`__ to `SASS <https://sass-lang.com/>`__ languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If ``customization.less`` file is used for customizing Portal colors with variables and not 
using other ``LESS`` syntax, you do not need to convert by tool, just change file type from ``*.less``
to ``*.scss`` manually and jump to :ref:`Put scss files to specific folder <put-scss-files-to-specific-folder>` step.

Please follow below step to do automation step convert your less file by
plugin ``less2sass.``

The **less2sass** converter is pretty good and maintained
https://www.npmjs.com/package/less2sass.

-  Install
   NoteJS on your system (can get by this page  https://nodejs.org/en/download). Once installed, restart your
   system as well.
-  Open Cmd command line and run command:
   npm install -g less2sass
-  Once installed you can simply run:
   ``less2sass 'path_to_less_file_or_directory'``

   E.g for path_to_less_file_or_directory:

   ``C:\Projects\Portal\axonivyportal\AxonIvyPortal\PortalStyle\webContent\resources\less\customization.less``

   |less-2-sass|

   After run above command, you also see a new
   \*.scss file is created into same folder.
   ``C:\Projects\Portal\axonivyportal\AxonIvyPortal\PortalStyle\webContent\resources\less\customization.scss``

.. _put-scss-files-to-specific-folder:

-   Put ``*.scss`` files to new folder as ``..\webContent\resources\sass\ivy``
-  Update customized variables manually:

.. table::

.. _installation-migration-notes-8-0-0-task-template:



How to migrate TaskTemplate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since Portal 8, we introduce iFrame so that customer project can be loaded inside iFrame. It can reduce side affect between customer project and Portal as well as migrate effort in future.
We now have 3 task templates 

- ``TaskTemplate.xhtml``, if you keep using TaskTemplate, it will keep your modena theme as before. For detail refer to :ref:`Task template <components-layout-templates-task-template>`
- ``DeprecatedTaskTemplate-7.xhtml``, change your template to DeprecatedTaskTemplate-7, it keeps your template with new Serenity theme and tab view. For detail refer to :ref:`Deprecated task template 7 <components-layout-templates-deprecated-task-template-7>`
- ``TaskTemplate-8.xhtml``, change your template to TaskTemplate-8, it's similar to DeprecatedTaskTemplate-7, it has new Serenity theme and no tab view. For detail refer to :ref:`Task template 8 <components-layout-templates-task-template-8>`

.. _installation-migration-notes-8-0-0-basic-template:


How to migrate BasicTemplate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are some changes in BasicTemplate. In the past, if you overwritten BasicTemplate ``footer`` section and copied responsive js in old BasicTemplate,
please copy the latest js in ``footer`` section of BasicTemplate.

.. _installation-migration-notes-8-0-0-task-body:

How to migrate TaskBody to  :ref:`customization-task-item-details` component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Portal version 8.0.0, we removed ``taskBody`` in TaskWidget. Instead
of that, we will use TaskItemDetails component to show task information
with more details and responsiveness.

If you have customized ``taskBody`` of TaskWidget, we need to migrate
the code of ``taskBody`` to new component as ``TaskItemDetails``

Please follow the below steps to migrate

-  You can take a look at ``PortalTaskDetails.xhtml`` to see how to use
   and customize ``TaskItemDetails``.

   There are 2 sections we need to take a look:

   -  On the ``taskItemDetailCustomPanelTop`` section.

      This section will be shown on the top ``TaskItemDetails``
      component. You can change the width of this panel as your
      requirement, we recommend to use ``ui-g-*`` class of ``Primeface``
      to define size of the width for the box can display flexibility.

   -  On the ``taskItemDetailCustomPanelBottom`` section.

      This section will be shown on the bottom of the ``TaskItemDetails``
      component. You can change the width of this panel as your requirement,
      we recommend to use ``ui-g-*`` class of ``Primeface`` to define size of 
      the width for the box can display flexibility.

   -  After deciding where we will push the custom code to ``TaskItemDetails``.

      Move your customized code for Custom box section from old
      ``taskBody`` to under that sections.

      Finally, your customization will be shown in the ``TaskItemDetails``.

   -  For example:

      Old taskBody

      |old-task-body|

      TaskItemDetail content

      |custom-task-item-details|

-  In case we need to hide Notes, Documents, we can refer to
   :ref:`Show/hide component on Task Item Details
   <customization-task-item-details-how-to-overide-ui-show-hidden-ui>` 

-  Additional, if we want to customize more ``TaskItemDetails``
   components, please refer to :ref:`TaskItemDetails component <customization-task-item-details-how-to-overide-ui>` 

.. _installation-migration-notes-8-0-0-case-body:

How to migrate CaseBody to :ref:`customization-case-item-details`  component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Portal version 8.0.0, we removed ``caseBody`` in CaseWidget. Instead
of that, we are using CaseItemDetails component for showing case
information with more details and responsiveness.

If you have customized ``caseBody`` of CaseWidget, we need to migrate
the code of ``caseBody`` to new component as ``CaseItemDetails``

Please follow below check list to migrate

-  You can take a look at ``PortalCaseDetails.xhtml`` to see how to use
   and customize ``CaseItemDetails``.

   There are 3 sections we need to take a look:

   -  On the ``caseItemDetailCustomTop`` section.

      This section will be shown on the top of the ``CaseItemDetails``
      component. You can define the width of this panel as your
      requirement, we recommend to use ``ui-g-*`` class of ``Primeface``
      to define size of the width for the box can display flexibility.

   -  On the ``caseItemDetailCustomMiddle`` section.

      This section will be shown on the middle of the
      ``CaseItemDetails`` component. You can define the width of this
      panel as your requirement, we recommend to use ``ui-g-*`` class of
      ``Primeface`` to define size of the width for the box can display
      flexibility.

   -  On the ``caseItemDetailCustomBottom`` section.

      This section will be shown on the bottom of the
      ``CaseItemDetails`` component. You can define the width of this
      panel as your requirement, we recommend to use ``ui-g-*`` class of
      ``Primeface`` to define size of the width for the box can display
      flexibility.

   -  After decided where we will push the custom code to
      ``CaseItemDetails``.

      Move your customized code for Custom box section from old
      ``caseBody`` to under that sections.

      Finally, your customization will be shown in ``CaseItemDetails``.

   -  For example:

      Old caseBody

      |case-body|

      CaseItemDetail content

      |case-item-details|

-  In case we need to hide Notes, Documents, Related running component,
   we can refer to :ref:`Show/hide component on Case Item Details
   <customization-case-item-details-how-to-override-ui-show-hidden-ui>` 

-  Additional, if we want to customize more ``CaseItemDetails``
   component, please help refer to :ref:`CaseItemDetails
   component <customization-case-item-details-how-to-override-ui>`

Migrate to 7.4.0
----------------

From 7.4.0, CaseTemplate is deprecated and we don't support it anymore.
If you are using CaseTemplate, please do consider to migrate to
TaskTemplate manually.

Migrate to 7.3.0
----------------

From 7.3.0, Portal supports some permissions to show/hide left menu
item, if you override ``LoadSubMenuItems`` process and want to use these
permissions, refer to
:ref:`Customization Menu <customization-menu-customization>`
for more detail.

There is a small change when initializing statistic chart, so if you
override ``DefaultChart.mod``, have a look at its note to see what is
changed.

Portal connector is removed, so there are many things related to it must
be adjusted. Check this list below

-  All ``Remote*`` classes are removed, replaced by the Ivy classes: ICase, ITask,
   IUser, IApplication, etc..
-  Use ``BuildTaskQuery`` and ``BuildCaseQuery`` callable process instead of
   ``BuildTaskJsonQuery``  and  ``BuildCaseJsonQuery``  .
-  If you override TaskLazyDataModel, remove
   ``extendSortTasksInNotDisplayedTaskMap`` method. Use ``criteria`` field instead of
   ``queryCriteria`` or ``searchCriteria``, use ``adminQuery`` field instead of
   ``ignoreInvolvedUser`` .
-  If you override CaseLazyDataModel: remove
   ``extendSortCasesInNotDisplayedTaskMap`` method. Use ``criteria`` field instead of
   ``queryCriteria`` or ``searchCriteria``, use ``adminQuery`` field instead of
   ``ignoreInvolvedUser`` .
-  If you override ChangePassword.mod: change process call from
   ``MultiPortal/PasswordService:changePasswordService(String,String)``  to  ``Ivy Data
   Processes/PasswordService:changePassword(String,String)``  .

Migrate hidden task and case to 7.3.0
-------------------------------------

Portal 7.0.10 has option to store hidden information in custom field of
task and case instead of additional property for better performance.
Other versions of Portal store these info in additional property.

If you use hide task/case feature, you need to follow these steps:

1. Deploy this project :download:`MigrateHiddenTaskCase.iar <documents/MigrateHiddenTaskCase.iar>` 
   to all your portal applications.
2. In each application, run start process
   ``MigrateHiddenTaskCase``  to migrate.
3. It's optional to clean up redundant data. After migration finishes
   successfully, run start process  ``RemoveHideAdditionalProperty``  in each
   application to clean up HIDE additional property. It will delete HIDE
   additional property of all tasks and cases in current application, so be
   careful with it.

Migrate 7.1.0 to 7.2.0
----------------------

Portal needs `Apache POI <https://poi.apache.org>`__ for exporting to
Excel features.

If you override task widget's data query described at
:ref:`How to override task widget's data query <customization-task-widget-how-to-override-data-query>`,
follow these steps to migrate

-  Add new start method with signature
   ``buildTaskJsonQuery(Boolean)``  in your overridden file of BuildTaskJsonQuery.mod
   (refer to original file BuildTaskJsonQuery.mod).
-  If you customized
   ``TaskLazyDataModel,``  change  ``withStartSignature("buildTaskJsonQuery()``  to
   ``withStartSignature("buildTaskJsonQuery(Boolean)").withParam("isQueryForHomePage",
   compactMode)``  in your customized  ``TaskLazyDataModel``  class.

There are some changes (DefaultApplicationHomePage, DefaultLoginPage,
GlobalSearch) in PortalStart process of Portal Template. If you have
customized this process in your project, copy the new PortalStart from
Portal Template to your project and re-apply your customization.

   .. important::
      In case you already have PortalStart process in your project, delete
      all elements in that process and copy everything from PortalStart
      process of Portal Template (to prevent start link id change).
      ``Do not delete`` PortalStart proccess in your project and copy new
      again.

      Check map param result of callable process after copy to make sure
      it's the same as original process.
      |copy-start-process|

EXPIRY_CHART_LAST_DRILLDOWN_LEVEL global variable is removed. User now
can use a context menu to drilldown Task By Expiry chart.

Migrate 7.0.3 to 7.0.5 (or 7.1.0)
---------------------------------

There are some changes in PortalStart process of Portal Template. If you
have customized this process in your project, copy the new PortalStart
from Portal Template to your project and re-apply your customization.

We introduce new method
``findStartableLinkByUserFriendlyRequestPath(String requestPath)`` in
``ProcessStartCollector`` class. If your project has customized
:ref:`Default user process <customization-default-user-process>`,
use this method to generate link to your process. If user doesn't have
permission to start the process, this method will return empty string.

   .. important::
      In case you already have PortalStart process in your project, delete
      all elements in that process and copy everything from PortalStart
      process of Portal Template (to prevent start link id change).
      ``Do not delete`` PortalStart proccess in your project and copy new
      again.

      Check map param result of callable process after copy to make sure
      it's the same as original process.

      |copy-start-process|

Migrate 7.0.2 to 7.0.3
----------------------

If you have additional columns in your customized task widget, refer 
:ref:`Task widget  <customization-task-widget-how-to-overide-ui-task-header>`  to adapt your
customization in ``taskHeader`` section.

Migrate 7.0.1 to 7.0.2
----------------------

In PortalStyle\pom.xml, update project-build-plugin version to
``7.1.0``\ and run maven to compile CSS.

If changing password is customized, change method call
``PasswordService.mod#changePassword(String,String)`` to
``PasswordService.mod#changePasswordService(String, String)`` in this
customization.

Custom fields in Portal task list can now be sorted properly. The method
``extendSort()`` of ``TaskLazyDataModel`` is changed to have a
``taskQuery`` parameter. If you override this method, change your code
to use the new parameter instead of using the ``criteria`` taskQuery.

Portal does not have separate full task list in the homepage anymore.
It's mean that you don't have to customize the task list in
``/layouts/DefaultHomePageTemplate.xhtml``. You can remove your task
list customization code in ``PortalHome.xhtml``.

If you have added new language to Portal by adding cms entry
``/AppInfo/SupportedLanguages`` in your project. Move this entry to
Portal Style.

Migrate 7.0.0 to 7.0.1
----------------------

**Ajax error handling**: By default, Portal handles all exceptions from
ajax requests. Old configuration, customization of ajax error handling
should be removed.

Migrate 6.x to 7.0.0
--------------------

If you copy the ``PortalStart`` process or the ``PortalHome`` HTMLDialog
for customizations, adapt the changes:

-  The whole process is refactored to be clearer. So it is recommended
   that you copy it again.

-  New process is introduced: restorePortalTaskList.ivp

-  PortalStart: some new ivy scripts are added to handle the navigation
   back to the same page before starting a task.

-  PortalHome: The ``taskView`` parameter is added to the start method.

SQL conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Portal ``7.0`` , we use standard axon.ivy Task Category field to
store task category.

To migrate task categories, deploy
:download:`MigrateTaskCategorySample.iar <documents/MigrateTaskCategorySample.iar>`
to your application and run ``Migrate Task Category`` process to:

1. Migrate data from column ``customVarCharField5`` to ``category`` for
   all tasks in the application.

2. Delete leftover data in ``customVarCharField5`` of all tasks in the
   application.

3. Create CMS entries for task categories in the application.

If you have queries which referring to task category, plese replace
``customVarCharField5()`` part with ``category()`` part.

Migrate 6.4 or 6.5 to 6.6
-------------------------

-  Task header is supported to be customized. The
   ``useOverride``  param, which is used to override the task item's body, is changed
   to  ``useOverrideBody`` 
-  If you customize  ``TaskLazyDataModel`` , remove that customized class and customize as
   :ref:`How to override task widget's data query. <customization-task-widget-how-to-override-data-query>` . 

Migrate 6.4 to 6.5
------------------

-  If compilation error "The type org.apache.axis2.databinding.ADBBean
   cannot be resolved" occurs, refer  `Project compilation classpath <https://developer.axonivy.com/doc/latest/doc/migrationNotes/MigrationNotesDesigner7.0.html#projectClasspath>`_  to fix.
-  The relative link in default user processes starts with ivy context
   path instead of "pro". If there are customized default user proceses, append
   context path at the beginning. E.g. in Portal  ``6.4`` , it is
   /pro/.../PortalStart.ivp. In Portal  ``6.5`` , change it to
   /ivy/pro/.../PortalStart.ivp. You may use :  ``ivy.html.startref(...)``  or
   ``RequestUriFactory.createProcessStartUri(...)``  to generate links.

Migrate 6.x (x < 4) to 6.4 (Jakobshorn)
---------------------------------------

Portal appearance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Portal ``6.4`` are redesigned. Therefore many components look different
from the previous version like menu, task list, case list ... . Portal
``BasicTemplate`` does not use ``p:layout`` and ``p:layoutUnit``
anymore. You may need to adapt your pages to this change.

For now the menu customization is not supported.

From ``6.4`` , Portal applies `LESS <http://lesscss.org/>`__ to support
customizing Portal styles. You can customize colors, fonts and Portal's
component styles. For more information about customizing Portal's style
with LESS, refer to
:ref:`PortalStyle customization (logos, colors, date patterns) <customization-portal-logos-and-colors>`
.

Steps to migrate

1. Copy PortalStyle/webContent/resources of Portal ``6.4`` to
   PortalStyle/webContent/resources of the current Portal.

2. Modify PortalStyle/webContent/resources/less/theme.less, update value
   of @body-background-color for the background color and @menu-color
   for the menu, button color.

3. Put custom styles to
   PortalStyle/webContent/resources/less/customization.less.

4. Add properties and plugins which are defined in PortalStyle/pom.xml
   of Portal ``6.4`` to PortalStyle/pom.xml of the current Portal.

5. Run the maven command ``mvn lesscss:compile`` in PortalStyle to build
   CSS file.

6. PortalStyle/webContent/resources/css/theme.css is obsolete, remove
   it.

Migrate 5.0 (Rothorn) to 6.0 (Säntis)
-------------------------------------

Database conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using Portal ``5.0`` , you have to manual configure all
settings (create servers, applications, variables) again since Portal
now doesn't use external database. All settings on from Portal ``6.0``
are stored in Ivy system database. If you are using Portal ``6.0`` , you
don't need to convert database.

Portal appearance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Portal now doesn't use `Modena <http://primefaces.org/eos/modena>`__
theme, it's a big difference to previous ``6.0`` . Therefore many things
in Portal ``5.0`` and ``6.0`` will not look the same in new Portal. Many
things have been redesigned like menu, task list, case list ...
