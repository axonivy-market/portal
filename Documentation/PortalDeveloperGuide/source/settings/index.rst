Setup multi portals
-------------------

.. important:: 
   
   There are 2 ways to configure portals: ``two levels`` and
   ``single level``

   -  Two levels portal

      |multi-application-with-portal|

      -  Used for related applications which we need an overview of all
         tasks and cases.

      -  Create a new application named Portal. Deploy portal (kit,
         template ..) to this application.

      -  Create new applications: App1, App2, App3... Deploy portal
         (kit, template ..) to new applications.

      -  Configure multi-apps Portal on single server: login by Portal
         Admin. Configure 1 server then configure applications: App1,
         App2, App3...

      -  Note that, ``do not`` add Portal application, it is reserved
         for displaying all tasks/cases... from all configured
         applications.

      -  Dashboard menu is only visible when logged-in user exists in
         Portal application.

   -  Single level portal

      |multi-application-without-portal|

      -  Used for independent applications.

      -  Create new applications: App1, App2, App3... Deploy portal(kit,
         template ..) to new applications. Note: must not create an
         application named Portal.

      -  Configure multi-apps Portal on single server: login by Portal
         Admin. Configure 1 server then configure applications: App1,
         App2, App3...

Open ``Admin Settings`` by selecting the item in ``UserMenu`` on the
topbar, if your page using layout of ``PortalTemplate`` .

|multi-portal-open-settings|

.. important:: 
   If your application does not use templates of PortalTemplate project, you
   have to create a page and use AdminSettings component inside.

..

.. tip:: To be able to open Admin Settings dialog, user needs to have role AXONIVY_PORTAL_ADMIN.

Add a new application

Choose ``Application`` tab on ``Admin Settings`` dialog and click on
``New`` button to add new application. Here you can choose application
type either as Ivy application or Third Party application.

|multi-portal-add-application|

   .. tip::

      -  ``Application name`` is the name of the application when you
         create it. ``Display name`` is the name of the application to be
         shown on Portal UI.

      -  ``Portal link`` specifies the link will be redirected when
         selecting the application on the application menu. It could be an
         absolute link (e.g.
         http://10.123.1.30:8000/ivy/pro/.../PortalStart.ivp) or relative
         link (e.g. /ivy/pro/.../PortalStart.ivp). If your application
         could be accessed from multiple domains, use relative link so that
         you can access the link from different domains.

      -  For multiple languages of application display name, you need to
         create the "AppInfo/SupportedLanguages" CMS which defines how many
         languages your application supports. See the below "Language
         settings" for more details.
