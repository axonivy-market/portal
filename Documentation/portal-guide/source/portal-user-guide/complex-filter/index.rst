Complex Filter 
**************

Introduction
------------
For easier viewing, Portal offers an intuitive and robust filtering system, allowing you to customize your view based on specific criteria.
This feature is available for the Case Widget and the Task Widget in Dashboard.

How to use
----------

- The Filters dialog can be accessed by clicking on the :guilabel:`Filters` button within the Task/Case Widget on the Dashboard, or by clicking on the :guilabel:`Filter` button within the Edit Widget Configuration panel on the Edit Dashboard. 
  Please refer to :ref:`new-dashboard` for more details. 

- To add a filter, select ``Add filter``, then select the column and operator, and input value if needed.  
    
    |filter-operator-dropdown|

- Portal allows you to combine filters, these filters connect to each other using the **AND** operator.

    |case-task-widget-filter-combine|

- Click on |remove-filter-icon| button to remove a filter.
- Click on ``Apply`` button to apply filters.

.. tip::
    For example, within a case widget, these filters are applied:

      |complex-filter-example|

    This filter configuration finds all cases in state OPEN, with case name containing 'Mike', created today.

If the task/case widget has been pre-configured with filters in the dashboard configuration, these filters will be displayed as read-only filters.

For more information about filter operators, please refer to the table :ref:`filter-operators`.

Save A Filter Set 
-----------------

On dashboard task/case widget, filters that have been added can be saved to a filter set by following these steps:

- Click on ``Save filter`` button, then enter the filter set name and click ``Save``.

- Saved filter sets will be displayed on the left side of the filter dialog.

- Select a filter set to apply it, and deselect it to remove the filter set.

- If a filter set name is bold, it means that filter set is currently applied.

- To search for a filter set, type the search value into the input field at the top of every column.
