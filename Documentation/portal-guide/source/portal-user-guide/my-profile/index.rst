.. _language-settings:

Language settings
-----------------

**Language** allows you to specify your
preferred application language. This setting will affect all |ivy|
Portal pages, notification mails, and – if supported – your company's application pages as
well. The following languages are currently supported in the |ivy|
Portal:

-  English
-  German
-  French
-  Spanish

**Formatting language** is used to format values, for example the decimal separator is displayed differently in different regions of the world.

.. hint:: 
   Your application needs to support
   the same language as the one     
   selected in this menu. Otherwise 
   the application specific content 
   will be shown in the standard    
   language of the application. E.g.
   if your application only supports
   English, but you select Spanish  
   as the Portal language, your     
   application specific dialogs will
   still be shown in English.    

.. _notification-channels:

Notification Channels
---------------------

**Notification Channels** allows you to configure your
manage subscriptions of the different kinds of notification channels in 
the |ivy| Engine.

The table :guilabel:`Notification Channels` displays all the available 
events that can either be subscribed or unsubscribed.

|notification-channels|

The checkbox in each event column allow you to specify 
three state of event: subscribed by default, subscribe, unsubscribe.
