.. _language-settings:

Language settings
-----------------

**Language settings** allows you to specify your
preferred application language. This setting will affect all Axon Ivy
Portal pages and – if supported – your company's application pages as
well. The following languages are currently supported in the Axon Ivy
Portal:

-  English

-  German

-  French

-  Spanish

.. hint:: 
   Your application needs to support
   the same language as the one     
   selected in this menu. Otherwise 
   the application specific content 
   will be shown in the standard    
   language of the application. E.g.
   if your application only supports
   English, but you select Spanish  
   as the portal language, your     
   application specific dialogs will
   still be shown in English.    

Email settings
--------------

**Email settings** allows you to configure your
preferences related to standard email notifications send by the Axon Ivy
Engine.

.. hint:: 
   If configured by your company’s application, you might also be able to configure application specific email notifications.   
..

Toggle button :guilabel:`Receive email notification on task assignment`  allows you to 
specify if you want to receive an instant notification when a task is assigned to you or one of the roles you hold.

Toggle button :guilabel:`Receive further emails from application`  allows you to activate / deactivate further email notifications.

Toggle button :guilabel:`Receive daily summary at`  allows you to specify the weekdays 
when you receive a summary of all tasks assigned to you or one of your roles.
