.. _language-settings:

Language settings
-----------------

**Language** allows you to specify your
preferred application language. This setting will affect all |ivy|
Portal pages, notification mails, and – if supported – your company's application pages as
well. The following languages are currently supported in the |ivy|
Portal:

-  English
-  German
-  French
-  Spanish

**Formatting language** is used to format values, for example the decimal separator is displayed differently in different regions of the world.

.. hint:: 
   Your application needs to support
   the same language as the one     
   selected in this menu. Otherwise 
   the application specific content 
   will be shown in the standard    
   language of the application. E.g.
   if your application only supports
   English, but you select Spanish  
   as the Portal language, your     
   application specific dialogs will
   still be shown in English.    

Email settings
--------------

**Email settings** allows you to configure your
preferences related to standard email notifications sent by the |ivy|
Engine.

.. hint:: 
   If configured by applications of your company, you might also be able to 
   configure application specific email notifications.   
..

The switch :guilabel:`Receive email notification on task assignment` allows you to 
specify if you want to receive an instant notification when a task is assigned to 
you or one of the roles you hold.

The switch :guilabel:`Receive further emails from application` allows you 
to activate or deactivate further email notifications.

The daily checkboxes :guilabel:`Receive daily summary at` allow you to specify the weekdays 
on which you receive a summary of all tasks assigned to you or one of your roles.
