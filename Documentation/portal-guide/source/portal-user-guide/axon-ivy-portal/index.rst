About This Guide
================

This document provides you—as a business user—with a comprehensive overview of the 
Axon Ivy Portal, its features, and functionalities.

.. note::
   The look and feel shown in the screenshots, as well as the features presented, are part 
   of the standard Axon Ivy Portal. However, Portal is highly configurable—your company's 
   Portal might have a different appearance, and some features might be disabled by your 
   administrator.

Getting Started
===============

Logging In
----------

To access the Portal, open the link provided by your administrator in a web browser. 
You will be prompted to enter your login credentials.

.. tip::
   **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: If your organization uses SSO, you may be automatically logged in 
   and forwarded directly to the Portal Dashboard without entering credentials.

.. note::
   **Password Reset**: If your organization uses the Ivy Security System, you can reset 
   your password using the :guilabel:`Forgot my password` link. See :ref:`forgot-password` 
   for detailed instructions.
   
   For external authentication systems (Active Directory, Entra ID, LDAP), contact your 
   IT department or use your organization's self-service password reset portal.

Understanding the Portal Interface
-----------------------------------

After successful login, you will see the Axon Ivy Portal Homepage with your personal dashboard. 
All your activities can be managed from this central entry point.

The Portal interface has three main areas:

**1. Portal Header** (always visible at top)

   |axon-ivy-portal-header|

   Provides global search, key information, and personal account settings.

**2. Side Menu** (always visible on left)

   Access to all processes, cases, tasks, and Portal features.
   
   - **Minimized**: Hover over the menu to temporarily enlarge it
   - **Expanded**: Click the pin button in the top left to permanently keep the menu expanded

**3. Main Content Area** (center)
