|ivy| Portal
***************

**|ivy| Portal** is the centerpiece for your daily work with the
applications you or your company implemented using |ivy|.
With a web-based, modern interface, the Portal provides you with key
functionalities on all your devices:

-  Access your applications and start new cases

-  Manage and fulfill tasks assigned to you or your roles

-  Understand what is going on by using on-the-spot statistics and
   historic data on all your cases and tasks

-  Improve your |ivy| Portal experience and efficiency through the
   built-in customization options

This document provides you – as a business user – with a comprehensive
overview of the |ivy| Portal, its features and functionalities.

.. Hint::
	The look and feel shown in the screenshots of this document, as well as the
	features presented are part of the standard |ivy| Portal. However,
	the |ivy| Portal is highly configurable, thus, the Portal of your company might
	have a different look and feel, and some features might be disabled by your
	administrator.

To start your |ivy| Portal experience, open the link provided by your
administrator in a web browser. The |ivy| Portal will ask you to enter your
login credentials.
