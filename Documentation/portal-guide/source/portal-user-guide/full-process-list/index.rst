Full Process List
*****************

The **Full Process List** page gives you an overview of all the processes in the
application available to you. To open the page, click :guilabel:`Processes` in
the |ivy| Portal menu.

.. note::

   Grant permission :bdg-ref-warning:`ðŸ”‘AccessFullProcessList <AccessFullProcessList>` to allow a user to see the full process list (:guilabel:`Processes`) in the |ivy| Portal menu.


|navigate-to-full-process-list|

On the **Full Process List** page, you see a list of all processes. They
are sorted alphabetically and grouped by their initial character. 

|portal-full-process-list-page|

   #. Search for a process, input your keyword here
   #. Image process icon
   #. Change view mode
   #. Process more menu item icon

Process Display Mode
--------------------

The **Full Process List** provides three modes to display the process list. By
default, **Image mode** is activated. To change the default process display mode, access :ref:`process-list-configuration` in ``My Profile``.

Image Mode
^^^^^^^^^^

|portal-process-image-view-page|

.. hint:: 
   To change the default image of processes, change
   the Portal setting **Portal.Processes.DefaultImage**.
   
   See :ref:`values_of_default_image`.

Grid Mode
^^^^^^^^^

|portal-process-grid-view-page|


Compact Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

|portal-process-list-view-page|

To find a specific process, search by keywords in the search field (top left
below the home icon in the image above). The search will look in process names,
process descriptions and process categories, then filter the process list
accordingly.

.. warning:: 
   Donâ€™t confuse the process search with the global |ivy| Portal 
   search which you find in the header area of the Portal.

To start a new instance of a process, select the process in the list. We call
this instance a **case**. After you finish your activities in the case, you will
be re-directed to the **Dashboard**, not to the :guilabel:`Full Process List`.

.. _values_of_default_image:

Values of Portal Setting **Portal.Processes.DefaultImage**
----------------------------------------------------------
#. You could refer to project ``portal-developer-examples`` for examples.
#. Start Process ``PhotoLibraryOfDefaultProcessImageExample``

   icon. Click the icon to open the ``Setting Multiple Languages`` dialog. You

   language fields. If you don't fill in a language field, the default language
   description will be used.

#. Grant permission :bdg-ref-warning:`ðŸ”‘CreatePublicExternalLink <CreatePublicExternalLink>` to allow a user to create public links to external sites. 
   This user can set this link as a public link by selecting :guilabel:`All users` .
   By default, :guilabel:`Visibility` field is not displayed and this new external link is a private link.

.. hint:: 
   Starting processes from the Full Process List page is fine if you require
