Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Accessibility collection for the Axon Ivy Portal provides tools and settings designed to enhance your experience and make it more inclusive, regardless of your abilities.
In this section, you will find features such as screen reader support, keyboard navigation via shortcuts, and text resizing.
Explore the collection to optimize your use of the Axon Ivy Portal and enjoy a more comfortable user experience.

Shortcuts navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, navigation through the portal sites is limited to using the tab key for keyboard navigation.
This approach can be restrictive for users who prefer or need to navigate using shortcuts. This new approach aims
to enhance accessibility by using shortcut navigation functionality using specific key combinations across
all portal sites, providing an alternative method for users to navigate directly to interactive elements.

You can navigate to specific interactive elements using predefined shortcuts.
