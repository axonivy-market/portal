Why is Accessibility Important?
===============================

   <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
In today's digital landscape, ensuring that front-end UIs are accessible to all users is not just a nice-to-have—it's essential. At Axon Ivy, we recognize the importance of making our Portal available to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. With this in mind, we've put significant thought into enhancing the accessibility features within the Axon Ivy Portal. This is only the beginning, and we are committed to continually improving these features. To ensure the highest quality, we have used tools such as the Microsoft Lighthouse Accessibility Checker and adhered to the guidelines of the WCAG 2.1 standard to evaluate and refine our UI.

Accessibility Approach in the Axon Ivy Portal
=============================================

   <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
We have taken a comprehensive approach to accessibility, addressing the most crucial aspects to create a more inclusive experience. Below are the key areas we have evaluated and implemented improvements.

Contrast
--------

   <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
The contrast between text, buttons, and background elements is vital for users with visual impairments. We have optimized the UI for both Dark Mode and Light Mode in line with the contrast ratios set by WCAG 2.1 standards. This ensures that all components—buttons, widgets, and backgrounds—meet the necessary contrast thresholds to enhance visibility and readability.

Zoom Capabilities
-----------------
.. raw:: html

   <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
We have revamped the zoom functionalities for both desktop and mobile versions of the Portal. Users can now easily zoom in and out while maintaining the clarity and usability of the UI, ensuring accessibility for users who require larger text and images to interact comfortably with the Portal.

Keyboard Navigation
-------------------
.. raw:: html

   <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
We have introduced basic keyboard shortcuts to streamline the user experience in the Portal, enabling users to quickly and effortlessly navigate between the main sections:


- **Alt + 1**: Jump to the Dashboard.
- **Sub-navigation in the Dashboard**: If multiple dashboards are available in the navigation bar, users can use the Tab key to cycle through them. Once the desired dashboard is highlighted, pressing Enter will open it.
- **Alt + 2**: Jump to the Process section.
- **Alt + 3**: Jump to the Task section.
- **Alt + 4**: Jump to the Case section.
- **Alt + 5**: Jump to the Search section.
- **Alt + 6**: Jump to User Settings.

Widget Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Task Widget**: Pressing Alt + W will focus on the first task in the Task widget. Pressing it again moves the focus to the next task in the list.
- **Case Widget**: Pressing Alt + Q focuses on the first case in the Case widget, and subsequent presses cycle through the list of cases.
- **Process Widget**: Pressing Alt + A focuses on the first process in the Process widget and cycles through the other processes sequentially.

Navigation for Multiple Task or Case Widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there are two Task or Case widgets on the screen, the focus will cycle through both widgets sequentially. After reaching the last element of the first widget, the focus automatically shifts to the first element of the second widget. If only one widget is present, the focus will loop back to the first element once the last element is reached, enabling continuous navigation.

Advanced Features
-----------------

Task Widget Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also use Task widget navigation to jump directly to the pop-ups for canceled tasks.

|reset-task-dialog|

Additionally, it is possible to navigate to the actions within the widget.

|task-actions-popup|

By pressing the Tab key, the focus can be set to the actions of a task. Once you are in the desired row, pressing Enter will open the context menu. You can then use the keyboard shortcut again to navigate through the menu. The Esc key can be used to exit the context menu at any time.

Example for Task Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to select a specific task, press **Alt + W** to focus on the first task. To access the associated actions, press the **Tab** key and then **Enter**. This opens the context menu. You can navigate through the menu by pressing the combination repeatedly to move from top to bottom. To exit the menu, press **Esc**.

Case Widget Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the Case widget navigation, you can also navigate into the actions of a case.

|case-actions-popup|

Press the keyboard shortcut to focus on the case, and pressing Enter will open the context menu. You can navigate through it by pressing the shortcut again, and exit the menu by pressing Esc.

Example for Case Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To select a specific case, press **Alt + Q** to reach the desired case. To access the associated actions, press **Enter** to open the context menu. Navigate through the menu by pressing the shortcut repeatedly, and press **Esc** to close it.

Browser & Keyboard Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These shortcuts are available in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge and work seamlessly with European, Asian, and American keyboard layouts.

Extended Descriptive Elements in the Task and Case List
-------------------------------------------------------
.. raw:: html

   <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
To improve navigation and accessibility in the Portal, we have not only implemented shortcuts for quick access to processes, tasks, and cases, but also added more descriptive elements to the widgets. These enhancements provide a clearer and more detailed display of key information, ensuring optimal support for screen readers.

Descriptive Elements in the Task Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first highlighted element in the task list, which is activated by the shortcut, includes the following information:

- **Task Name**: The name or title of the task.
- **Priority**: The priority level of the task (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Status**: The current status of the task (e.g., In Progress, Completed, Open).
- **Expiry Date**: The due date of the task.

When a user focuses on the first task element using a keyboard shortcut, the screen reader reads the information in the following format:
"Task Start - Task Name: `<task name>` - Priority: `<priority>` - Status: `<status>` - Expiry Date: `<expiry date>`."

Descriptive Elements in the Case Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case list, additional information is also integrated into the highlighted action field:

- **Case Name**: The name or title of the case.
- **State**: The current state of the case (e.g., Open, Done, Deleted).
- **Created On**: The creation date of the case.
- **Finished On**: The completion date of the case.
- **Owner**: The current owner of the case.

When a user jumps to the first case element using a shortcut, the screen reader reads the information in the following format:
"Case Name: `<case name>` - State: `<state>` - Created On: `<creation date>` - Finished On: `<finish date>` - Owner: `<owner name>`."
If the selected task or case is not in the "Completed" state, all relevant details are read aloud to inform the user of the current status.

Integration of Microsoft Narrator Screen Reader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We rely on Microsoft Narrator to support screen readers. It can be activated via the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Windows key + Enter**. This ensures that users with visual impairments can easily navigate through the Portal and understand the information provided.

Language Support for Screen Readers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure screen readers function correctly, we have incorporated language settings directly into the HTML page element. These settings respect the user's language preferences, allowing the screen reader to read the content in the user's preferred language. These adjustments ensure full accessibility for visually impaired users and greatly enhance their experience with the Portal.

Text Alternatives for Buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have implemented ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes across many elements, including buttons, to ensure they are easily identifiable by screen readers. This allows users who rely on assistive technologies to interact with the Portal more effectively.

Accessibility Dashboard Templates
=================================
.. raw:: html

   <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
To further enhance usability, we have created an **Accessibility Dashboard** that simplifies navigation for users with disabilities. This dashboard features a dedicated element that displays available shortcuts. When the screen is opened, this element is automatically focused and read aloud by the screen reader. Each time the dashboard is accessed, the shortcuts are read aloud to ensure accessibility.

Additionally, we have enriched the **task** and **case** elements with metadata such as name, assignee, and other relevant details. These are included as descriptive elements, allowing screen readers to provide immediate feedback upon focusing on these items.

Integrating the Accessibility Dashboard
---------------------------------------

You can easily integrate this feature by selecting the **"Accessibility Dashboard"** template when creating a dashboard.

|accessibility-dashboard-creation|

The dashboard contains the following elements:

- A **Shortcuts Widget** that displays and reads the available shortcuts aloud via a screen reader.
- A **Process List Widget** to display the ongoing processes.
- A **Task List Widget** to show tasks.
- A **Case List Widget** for managing cases.

These widgets are optimized for use with accessibility features and for displaying them on the dashboard.

Adding the Shortcut Widget to any Dashboard
-------------------------------------------

The **Shortcut Widget** can also be integrated into any other dashboard.
Follow these steps:

1. Create a custom dashboard widget.
2. Select the widget type: **"Custom Dashboard Widget"**.
3. Choose the **Accessibility Shortcut Widget**.
4. Add it to the screen.
