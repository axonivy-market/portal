User Settings in the |ivy| Portal
------------------------------------

When you click on your username in the top right of the |ivy| Portal,
a menu is shown allowing you to configure the Portal to your personal
needs. These features are described in the following sections below.

Absences
--------

Menu entry :guilabel:`Absences` provides you with an absence management
component. Here you can enter your absence and define delegate for
tasks assigned to you or one of the roles you hold.

.. hint::
   Although you can specify
   delegates for a role you hold, we recommend specifying only delegates for tasks
   assigned personally to you. Roles are normally held by a group of users, so if
   youâ€™re absent one of your role members is still able to pick the task.

|portal-absences|

The dialog shows you all current and upcoming absences. You may show also past
absences by activating the option :guilabel:`Show absences in the past`. Furthermore,
you can edit or delete absences by using the |edit-icon| **Edit** or |trash-icon|
**Delete** action in the row of the respective absence.

might be asked for this information in case you issue a support request.

|portal-version-information|

Logout
------

The menu entry :guilabel:`Logout` will terminate your session in the |ivy|

.. hint::
   The |ivy| Portal will also do
   an automatic logout if youâ€™re
   inactive for a certain amount of
   time.

Global Search
-------------

The Global Search is a convenient tool for you to look up
information in the whole |ivy| Portal. You may search for any
keyword. By default, the |ivy| Portal will search for:

#. Processes

#. Cases

#. Tasks

When you confirm the keyword youâ€™re looking for, the |ivy| Portal
will route you to the **Global Search Results** page. For each category
a tab is provided, giving you the results of your search.

|portal-global-search-result-page|

HowTo: Limit search scope of Global Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Global Search looks for data that match your input in these fields:

   - Task fields: Id, name, and description.
   - Case fields: Id, name, description, and any custom string field.

As an administrator, you may want to limit fields which Global Search should be looking for.
Portal provides two variables to help you:

   - ``Portal.SearchScope.ByCaseFields``: Defining the fields that the global search
     will use to find matching cases besides case Id (this can influence the performance of the search).
   - ``Portal.SearchScope.ByTaskFields``: Defining the fields that the global search
     will use to find matching tasks besides task Id (this can influence the performance of the search).
   - ``Portal.GlobalSearchScopeCategories``: Defining the types that the global search will search for.
     (this can influence the performance of the search).

You can configure these variables by :ref:`settings-admin-settings`.
