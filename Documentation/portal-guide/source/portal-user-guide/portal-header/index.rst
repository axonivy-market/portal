User Settings in the Axon Ivy Portal

Absences

component. Here you can enter your absence and define delegate for
tasks assigned to you or one of the roles you hold.

.. hint::
   Although you can specify         
   delegates for a role you hold, we recommend specifying only delegates for tasks
   assigned personally to you. Roles are normally held by a group of users, so if
   you’re absent one of your role members is still able to pick the task.
