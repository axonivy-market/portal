Full Task List
**************

The **Full Task List** page shows you the tasks, as well as, advanced search and filter
capabilities. You can reach the page by using the |task-list-icon| :guilabel:`Tasks` 
link in the |ivy| Portal menu.

.. note::

   Grant permission :bdg-ref-warning:`ðŸ”‘AccessFullTaskList <AccessFullTaskList>` to allow a user to access the full task list ( |task-list-icon| :guilabel:`Tasks`) in the |ivy| Portal menu.


.. hint:: 
   Depending on the roles you hold
   in the application and the     
   configuration of the |ivy|  
   Portal, you might see not only 
   the tasks belonging to you but 
   all open tasks.     

   Visibility tasks assigned to roles depending on state:

   - Open: Visible for all members

   - In Progress: Visible for all members, but "parked" for working user (no actions possible for other role members)

   - Done: Visible for all members

|navigate-to-full-task-list-page|

On the top of the **Full Task List** page you see next to the heading
:guilabel:`Tasks` in brackets the overall number of tasks shown to you. Below you find the filter feature.

#. Responsible user or role

#. Task ID

#. Creation Date

#. Expiry Date

#. Status
