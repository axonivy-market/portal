HowTo: Enable the translation
-----------------------------

To use Axon Ivy's translation service:

- Configure translation service variable, refer to :dev-url:`|ivy| translation service </doc/|version|/engine-guide/configuration/translation-service/index.html>`

HowTo: Translate a pure text
----------------------------

#. If any input text field is supported the translation, a :guilabel:`translator icon` will be shown.
   For example, let's create a private dashboard. Then, click on the :guilabel:`translator icon`.

   |create-private-dashboard-dialog|

#. A Setting multiple languages dialog is shown.

   |dashboard-multi-language-dialog|

#. Click on the input text field of a foreign language to have it translated by Axon Ivy's translation service. To accept the translated text, clicking on :guilabel:`Auto. translation`.
