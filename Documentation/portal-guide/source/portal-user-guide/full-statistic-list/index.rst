Full Statistics page
********************

One way to consume statistics is through your personal dashboard (see
:ref:`dashboard`). If you need a deeper insight in what is going on, the
:guilabel:`Full Statistics` page provides you with the perfect toolset. You can
consume statistics and charts here at one glance and have the chance to setup
your own statistics. You can reach the page by using the 
**Statistics** link in the Axon.ivy Portal menu or by using the **Show all
charts** quick link in the statistics section of your dashboard.

.. hint:: 
   The statistics allow you to evaluate case and task data only. Business data
   from your processes is not available in these statistics and must be
   considered separately.                      

.. figure:: images/navigate-to-full-statistics-page.png

On the :guilabel:`Full Statistics` page you see all charts that were previously
created. Each chart provides you with the following features:

.. figure:: images/full-statistics-page-chart-detail.png

1. The heading of the chart

2. An |info-icon| **Info** button, providing you with the configuration of
   the chart

.. figure:: images/full-statistics-page-chart-info-detail.png

3. Arrow buttons (|arrow-right-icon|, |arrow-left-icon|) depending
   on the position of the chart to allow you rearrangement according to
   your personal needs

4. The chart itself. It might provide you with a drill down function
   down to the task level.

5. The legend, explaining the part of the charts
