Axon Ivy Express
****************

So far, this document familiarized you with the Axon Ivy Portal and
explained how you can use processes provided to you by your IT
department. The following chapter takes you to the next level.

**Axon Ivy Express** is a module of the Axon Ivy Portal. It
enables you – as a business user – to create your own process
applications and share them with your colleagues. These capabilities are
also known as No-Code Application Platforms or Citizen Developer
Platforms. Therefore, it is the perfect tool for you to digitize your
processes and create standardization, reliability and traceability. Some
of the key features of Axon Ivy Express are:

-  It is a **No Coding Toolset**, allowing business users to create
   processes without IT background.

-  The **Axon Ivy Portal Integration**, allows business users to
   implement processes without IT department involvement.

-  The **Seamless Integration** into the Axon Ivy
   allows you to make use of standard features like email
   notifications, task delegation, etc.

-  The **Powerful Toolset** allows you to create processes, define
   different task types, set responsibilities and due dates and define
   user dialogs for each task.

You can reach the page by either using the :guilabel:`Processes`  link
in the Axon Ivy Portal menu or the quick link :guilabel:`Show all processes`  in
your dashboard.

|navigate-to-axon-ivy-express|

Below the heading **Processes**, you see the link :guilabel:`Create express workflow`.
This feature is explained in detail in `Axon Ivy Express`_. Below
you find the process category **Express Workflows** with a list of
already defined processes.

HowTo: Create an Express Workflow
---------------------------------

#. Click on the link :guilabel:`Create Express Workflow` 

#. The :guilabel:`Express Workflow` editor is opened

#. Define the :guilabel:`Type of process` :

   -  Use the option *One time* if you want to execute the
      process only one time

   -  Use the option *Repeatable* if you want to save the
      process for repetitive use. The process will automatically be
      deployed and added to the Full Process List page.

#. Define your :guilabel:`User Interface` :

   -  With the option *Create own* you can create your own user dialogs
      for each process step

   -  With the option *Use default,* the user dialogs will be
      automatically generated by Axon Ivy Express

#. Provide a speaking name under :guilabel:`Process name` 

#. You may add a description under :guilabel:`Process description`. We strongly
   encourage you to use the description to provide details about your
   process.

#. Define the best icon for your process by click on the **Change** link beside :guilabel:`Icon`

   |express-workflow-process-properties|

#.  The first process step is already available for your configuration

#.  You may add further process steps using the button :guilabel:`Add process step` 

#.  You may delete unnecessary process steps using the button :guilabel:`Remove process step` 

#. For each process step, select the :guilabel:`Task Type`  (see `Express Workflow task types`_).

#. For each process step, provide a speaking name under :guilabel:`Task Name` 

#. For each process step, you may provide a description under :guilabel:`Task description`.

#. For *One time* process type, the first process step defines the users or roles under
   :guilabel:`Able to start`  who can start the process

   |express-able-to-start|

#. For all other process steps define under :guilabel:`Responsible`  the user or roles who are responsible to execute the task.

   |express-task-responsible|

#. For each process step except the first define under :guilabel:`Expiry in days`  the time before the task expires

#. End the configuration of your process steps with the button :guilabel:`Next`
