|ivy| Express
****************

So far, this document familiarized you with the |ivy| Portal and
explained how you can use processes provided to you by your IT
department. The following chapter takes you to the next level.

**|ivy| Express** is a module of the |ivy| Portal. It
enables you ‚Äì as a business user ‚Äì to create your own process
applications and share them with your colleagues. These capabilities are
also known as No-Code Application Platforms or Citizen Developer
Platforms. Therefore, it is the perfect tool for you to digitize your
processes and create standardization, reliability and traceability. Some
of the key features of |ivy| Express are:

-  It is a **No Coding Toolset**, allowing business users without an IT
   background to create processes.

-  The **|ivy| Portal Integration**, allows business users to
   implement processes without IT department involvement.

-  The **Seamless Integration** into |ivy|
   allows you to make use of standard features like email
   notifications, task delegation, etc.

-  The **Powerful Toolset** allows you to create processes, define
   different task types, set responsibilities and due dates and define
   user dialogs for each task.

You can reach |ivy| Express by using the link ``Processes``
in the |ivy| Portal menu.

|navigate-to-axon-ivy-express|

Below the heading **Processes**, you see the link ``Create Express Workflow``.
Below, you find the process category **Express Workflows** with a list of
predefined processes.

HowTo: Create an Express Workflow
---------------------------------

#. Click on ``Create Express Workflow``.

#. The :guilabel:`Express Workflow` editor is opened.

#. Define the :guilabel:`Type of process`:

   -  Use the option *One time* if you want to execute the
      process only once.

   -  Use the option *Repeatable* if you want to save the
      process for repetitive use. The process will automatically be
      deployed and added to the Full Process List page.

#. Define your :guilabel:`User Interface` :

   -  With the option *Create own* you can create your own user dialog
      for each process step

   -  With the option *Use default,* the user dialogs will
      automatically be generated by |ivy| Express

#. Provide a descriptive name under :guilabel:`Process name` 

#. You may add a description under :guilabel:`Process description`. We strongly
   encourage you to use the description to provide details about your
   process.

#. Click on the link ``Change`` besides :guilabel:`Icon` to select the icon best suited for your process.

   |express-workflow-process-properties|

#.  The first process step is already available for configuration.

#.  You may add further process steps using the button :guilabel:`Add process step` 

#.  You may delete unnecessary process steps using the button :guilabel:`Remove process step` 

#. For each process step, 

   #. select the :guilabel:`Task Type` (see `Express Workflow task types`_).
   #. provide a descriptive name in :guilabel:`Task Name` 
   #. provide an optional description in :guilabel:`Task description`.

#. For *One time* process type, the first process step defines the users or roles under
   :guilabel:`Able to start` who can start the process

   |express-able-to-start|

#. For all other process steps define the user or roles who are responsible to execute the task in :guilabel:`Responsible` .

   |express-task-responsible|

#. For each process step except the first define the time before the task expires in :guilabel:`Expiry in days` 

#. End the configuration of each process step by pressing :guilabel:`Next`
