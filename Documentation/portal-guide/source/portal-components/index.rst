Portal Components
*****************

Portal Components are reusable UI components and Java APIs that you can integrate into your own Axon Ivy projects without importing the full Portal.
These components provide enterprise-ready functionality for user selection, role management, document handling, process visualization, and more.

Portal Components support both Freya and Serenity themes of PrimeFaces, though we strongly recommend using Freya as Serenity is deprecated and will be removed in Portal 13.
