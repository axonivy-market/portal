Portal Components
*****************

In ``portal-components``, we introduced some components independent of the Portal.
You don't need to import the Portal projects to use them.

These components fully support both Freya and Serenity themes of PrimeFaces.
We strongly recommend using the Freya theme, as Serenity is deprecated and
will be removed in Portal 13.
