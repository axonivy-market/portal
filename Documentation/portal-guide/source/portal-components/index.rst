Portal Components
*****************

In ``portal-components``, we introduced some components independent of the Portal.
You don't need to import the Portal projects to use them.

These components fully support both Freya and Serenity themes of Primefaces. We strongly recommend using the Freya theme, as the Serenity theme is deprecated and will be removed in Portal 13.

   style-customization/index

Please refer to project ``portal-components-examples`` for more details on use and customization,
as well as look and feel of each component in supported themes.
