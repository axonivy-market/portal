Portal Components
*****************

In ``portal-components``, we introduced some components independent of the Portal.
You don't need to import the Portal projects to use them.

These components fully support both Freya and Serenity themes of Primefaces.

   document-table/index
   security-member-name-and-avatar/index
   user-selection/index
   role-selection/index
   process-viewer/index
   style-customization/index

Please refer to project ``portal-components-examples`` for more details on use and customization,
as well as look and feel of each component in supported themes.
