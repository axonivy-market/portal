What is RAG?
============

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation to produce more accurate and contextual responses.

Core Concept
------------

RAG enhances language models by:

1. **Retrieving** relevant information from external knowledge bases
2. **Augmenting** the prompt with retrieved context
3. **Generating** responses based on both the query and retrieved information

Architecture
============

Basic Components
----------------

.. code-block:: text

   Query → Retriever → Knowledge Base
     ↓         ↓
   Generator ← Context

Key Components:

* **Retriever**: Finds relevant documents/passages
* **Knowledge Base**: External source of information (vector DB, documents)
* **Generator**: Language model that produces the final response
* **Embeddings**: Vector representations for semantic search

Workflow
========

RAG Process
-----------

1. **Index Creation**

   * Split documents into chunks
   * Generate embeddings for each chunk
   * Store in vector database

2. **Query Processing**

   * Convert user query to embedding
   * Search for similar chunks in vector DB
   * Retrieve top-k most relevant passages

3. **Response Generation**

   * Combine query + retrieved context
   * Feed to language model
   * Generate contextually informed response

Advantages
==========

Benefits of RAG
---------------

* **Up-to-date Information**: Access to current data beyond training cutoff
* **Domain Specificity**: Can work with specialized knowledge bases
* **Reduced Hallucination**: Grounds responses in actual source material
* **Transparency**: Can cite sources and show retrieved context
* **Cost Effective**: No need to retrain large models

Use Cases
=========

Common Applications
-------------------

* **Document Q&A**: Query large document collections
* **Customer Support**: Access product manuals and FAQs
* **Research Assistant**: Search academic papers and reports
* **Enterprise Search**: Internal knowledge management
* **Legal/Medical**: Domain-specific information retrieval

Implementation Tools
====================

Popular Frameworks
------------------

* **LangChain**: Python framework for LLM applications
* **LlamaIndex**: Data framework for LLM applications
* **Haystack**: End-to-end NLP framework
* **Pinecone/Weaviate**: Vector databases
* **OpenAI Embeddings**: Text embedding models

Challenges
==========

Common Issues
-------------

* **Chunk Size**: Balancing context vs. precision
* **Retrieval Quality**: Ensuring relevant documents are found
* **Context Length**: Managing token limits in prompts
* **Latency**: Real-time performance considerations
* **Cost**: API calls for embeddings and generation

Best Practices
==============

Implementation Tips
-------------------

1. **Optimize Chunking**

   * Use semantic splitting (sentences, paragraphs)
   * Consider overlap between chunks
   * Test different chunk sizes

2. **Improve Retrieval**

   * Use hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
   * Implement re-ranking mechanisms
   * Fine-tune embedding models if needed

3. **Context Management**

   * Prioritize most relevant chunks
   * Implement context compression
   * Handle multiple document sources

.. note::
   RAG is particularly effective for knowledge-intensive tasks where accuracy and source attribution are important.

.. warning::
   Quality of retrieved documents directly impacts the final response quality. Ensure your knowledge base is well-curated and up-to-date.
