The basic structure of JSON of Task widget

   ``type``: type of widget. Use ``task`` to mark that this widget is a task widget

   ``id``: ID of the widget

   ``name``: Name of the widget on UI

   ``layout``: layout definition of task widget

      ``x``: HTML DOM Style ``left`` will be calculated by formula ``x / 12 * 100%``

      ``y``: HTML DOM Style ``top`` will be calculated by formula ``y / 12 * 100%``

      ``w``: HTML DOM Style ``width`` will be calculated by formula ``60 * w + 20 * (w - 1)``

      ``h``: HTML DOM Style ``height`` will be calculated by formula ``60 * h + 20 * (h - 1)``

      ``styleClass`` (optional): add CSS Classes to HTML DOM of Task widget

      ``style`` (optional): add inline style to HTML DOM of Task widget

   ``sortField``: default sort field for task widget

   ``sortDescending``: sort direction of the default sort field is descending or not. The default value is "false"

   ``rowsPerPage``: the number of tasks can be displayed on one page of the task widget. 
   The default value is 10 rows per page

   ``columns``: column configurations for each column in the task widget. You can predefine
   filters, styles, visibility,... of columns and define custom columns also

      ``field``: the field name of the column
         
         For standard column, ``field`` must be one of these columns
         
            - ``start``: column which contains start button to start the task directly.
  
            - ``priority``: task priority

            - ``id``: task ID

            - ``name``: task name

            - ``description``: task description

            - ``activator``: task activator

            - ``state``: task state

            - ``startTimestamp``: created date and time of the task

            - ``expiryTimestamp``: expiry date and time of the task

         For custom column, ``field`` is the name of a task custom field.
         Portal will use the value of ``field`` attribute to get the value of the column.

      ``canWorkOn``: filter only tasks that the current user can work on. The default value is "false".

      ``visible``: visibility of a column. The default value is "true".
      Set to "false" to hide the column.

      ``header``: header text of the column. You can input a string, or can use
      CMS by using prefix ``cms:`` before your CMS URI to define header
      in multilingual.

Custom columns
--------------

Axon Ivy supports custom fields for the task.
You can show them on the Task widget in form of a column.

More, you can predefine which column to show, and other attributes such as header,
filter, format. Below is a standard JSON of a custom column.

.. code-block:: html

   {
      ...
      
      "columns": [
         {
            "format": "string",
            "header": "cms:columns/custom/supplier",
            "field": "supplier",
            "style": "width: 110px"
         }
      ]
   }

..

Besides attributes explained in the previous section, a custom column has two differences:

   - ``format``: Type of custom column. There are four formats ``string``, ``text``, ``number``, and ``timestamp``.

   - ``field``: this attribute is the name of the task's custom field which will be used to get data for the column.

You can predefined filter conditions for most columns of the task widget.

a string, and some only accept a string in a special format such as date-time.
