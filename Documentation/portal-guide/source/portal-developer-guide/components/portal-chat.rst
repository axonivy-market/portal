Information
-----------

Chat feature is reimplemented from Ivy 7.4.

There are two modes of chat: Group chat and Private chat. Both features
are disabled by default.

1. You can turn on private chat with this Global setting:
   **ENABLE_PRIVATE_CHAT**.

2. You can turn on group chat with this Global setting:
   **ENABLE_GROUP_CHAT**.

3. If browsers access Portal through a reverse proxy Nginx, set Global
   setting **CHAT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT** a number less than Nginx timeout to
   make chat work properly.
