.. _customization-document-processes-introduction:

Introduction
------------

When you upload document but want to manage them outside ivy, for
example: in Document Management System (DMS), you should follow this
section to override document functions of Portal.

Customization
-------------

#. Introduce an |ivy| project which has ``portal`` as a
   required library.

#. Copy the ``PortalStart`` process from ``portal`` to your
   project. This process is new home page and administrator should
   register this link by global

#. Refer to :ref:`Customize Portal
   home <customization-portal-home>` to set new home
   page.

#. Override 4 ``Document subprocesses`` described in table below to
   customize document functions.
