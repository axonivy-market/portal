========================

Define Process widget
---------------------

Process widget of Portal dashboard is a flexible Process list with three modes.
Refer to (link to process widget of the dashboard) for more details.

Basic JSON structure of process widget:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
         "type": "process",
         "id": "process-widget",
         "name": "Process Widget",
         "displayMode": "FULL_MODE",
         "layout": {
            "x": 10, "y": 0, "w": 2, "h": 4
         }
      }
   ..

Besides basic attributes of Dashboard's widget, the process widget has required attribute `displayMode`.
This attribute is used to define the display mode of the widget.

There are three display modes for the process widget: ``FULL_MODE`` (full mode), ``COMPACT_MODE``
(compact mode), and ``COMBINED_MODE`` (combined mode).

Each mode has differences in its JSON definition. Refer to the below sections to understand
how to define the process widget in these modes properly.
