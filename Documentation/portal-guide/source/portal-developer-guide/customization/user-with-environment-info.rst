User with environment info
==========================

This component shows environment info when the ``SHOW_ENVIRONMENT_INFO`` variable is activated.

|user-with-environment-info|

You could change the displayed information by overriding the ``UserWithEnvironmentInfo`` Html Dialog, refer to 
:dev-url:`/doc/8.0.30/designer-guide/how-to/overrides.html#overrides-tool-reference`.

If you use Case Scope, you need to copy the ``PortalStart`` process from ``PortalTemplate`` to your project and
it is ensured that the process request is issued through your project instead of PortalTemplate
