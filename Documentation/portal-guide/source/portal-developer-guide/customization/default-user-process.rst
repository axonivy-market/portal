Default user process configuration is stored as 
:dev-url:`Variables </doc/9.3.3/designer-guide/configuration/variables.html>`.
You could update the variable :ref:`portal-dashboard-favorite-processes` to customize default user processes.

.. tip::
    - The default processes are sorted by their index attribute. If this attribute is not set, the process will be put at the bottom of the list.
