Setup Portal settings by configuration file in Designer
=======================================================

To manually configure Portal settings, refer to :ref:`update-portal-settings`.

In development, it is a quite tedious task to configure Portal settings after restarting Designer. Therefore,
Portal supports modification of Portal settings in Designer by configuration file, it could survive after restarting Designer.

Process developer can set up Portal settings of Portal in file ``portal_settings_config.properties`` which put in ``PortalKit``.

   .. code-block:: Python

      # This file is for developer configure values for Portal settings.
      # As developer, you only need to remove comment mark of corresponding settings and modify their values.
      # Portal will apply setting values once you start designer.

      #HIDE_SYSTEM_TASKS_FROM_HISTORY = true
      #HIDE_SYSTEM_TASKS_FROM_HISTORY_ADMINISTRATOR = false

This file already contains list of settings with their default values.
These settings will be applied once you start Portal.

If you change configuration file while coding, please stop engine in designer and start engine again to apply changes.

.. _settings-admin-settings-setup-multi-portals:

Setup Portal multi applications
-------------------------------

Portal provides two types of multi applications: ``Multi applications with overview`` and ``Multi applications (without overview)``

Multi applications with overview
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. important::

   Used for related applications App1, App2, App3... of which we need to see all
   tasks/cases in one page. Task/Case list of application named ``Portal`` would display all
   tasks/cases of applications App1, App2, App3...

|multi-application-with-portal|


-  Create a new application named ``Portal``. Deploy Portal (Kit,
   Template ..) to this application.

-  Create new applications: App1, App2, App3... Deploy Portal
   (Kit, Template ..) to new applications.

-  Configure multi-apps Portal: login by Portal
   Admin, configure applications: App1,
   App2, App3...

-  Note that, ``do not`` add the application named ``Portal``, it is reserved
   for displaying all tasks/cases... from all configured
   applications.

-  Dashboard menu is only visible when logged-in user exists in
   Portal application.

Multi applications (without overview)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. important::

   Used for independent applications App1, App2, App3... of which we ``do not`` need to see all
   tasks/cases in one page.


|multi-application-without-portal|

-  Create new applications: App1, App2, App3... Deploy Portal (Kit,
   Template ...) to new applications. Note: must not create an
   application named ``Portal``.

-  Configure multi-apps Portal: login by Portal
   Admin, configure applications: App1,
   App2, App3...

.. _settings-language:

Language settings
=================

-  Below is applied language setting precedence:

   |language-precedence|

   If user email language setting is application default, language would
   be applied by application email language setting.

   If user selects a language in email setting, language would be
   appplied by this selection.

-  To configure languages of Portal applications, select
   ``Language Settings`` in ``User Settings``.

-  UI reads current languages settings for all applications.

-  To change language for application, select one in the languages
   dropdown list of application. When the change is saved, the language
   will be set for application (Click on the application in header menu
   to reload application and see the change of language).

   |language-settings|

-  For multiple languages, the CMS key ``/AppInfo/SupportedLanguages``
   must exist in your application. From Portal 7.1, this CMS entry is
   moved to Portal Style. It contains list of all languages supported by
   your application, separated by comma.

   -  Must not contain spaces
   -  Same as display name of Locale
   -  Separated by comma
   -  Process model version, which has this CMS, must active

-  To add new language to Portal, what you have to do is

   -  Open CMS item ``/AppInfo/SupportedLanguages`` in Portal Style, then add new language for example Italian 
      |add-new-item-to-cms-language|
   -  Add new language locale to all items, you can input either language code ``it`` or language code with country ``it-CH``. If you use language code with country, refer to `Java supported locales <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-suported-locales.html>`_ .
   
      |add-new-item-to-cms-language-after|
   -  Export all CMS entries of Portal Style to excel file then add translation of new language for all CMS entries
      |export-cms|
   -  Import file excel back.
   -  Redeploy Portal Style.

.. _virus_scanning_setting:

Virus Scanning Setting 
======================

PrimeFaces is delivered with one implementation of that interface that uses
`VirusTotal <https://www.virustotal.com/>`_. To enable `VirusTotal
<https://www.virustotal.com/>`_ you need to create a community account at the
`VirusTotal website <https://www.virustotal.com/>`_. You receive an API key once
you have an account. To configure the API key add the following snippet to the
webapps/ivy/WEB-INF/web.xml file:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <context-param>
      <param-name>primefaces.virusscan.VIRUSTOTAL_KEY</param-name>
      <param-value>PUT YOUR API KEY HERE</param-value> 
      </context-param>

   ..

By default after configured context-param in the web XML file, the Virus
Scanning is disabled. You could update the value of the variable
``ENABLE_VIRUS_SCANNER_FOR_UPLOADED_DOCUMENT`` to ``true`` in
``portal_settings_config.properties`` that you want to enable.
