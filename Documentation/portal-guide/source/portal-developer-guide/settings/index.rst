Setup Portal settings by configuration file in Designer
=======================================================

To manually configure Portal settings, refer to :ref:`update-portal-settings`.

In development, it is a quite tedious task to configure Portal settings after restarting Designer. Therefore,
Portal supports modification of Portal settings in Designer by configuration file, it could survive after restarting Designer.

Process developer can set up Portal settings of Portal in file ``portal_settings_config.properties`` which put in ``PortalKit``.

   .. code-block:: Python

      # This file is for developer configure values for Portal settings.
      # As developer, you only need to remove comment mark of corresponding settings and modify their values.
      # Portal will apply setting values once you start designer.

This file already contains list of settings with their default values.
These settings will be applied once you start Portal.

If you change configuration file while coding, please stop engine in designer and start engine again to apply changes.

.. _settings-language:

Language settings
=================

-  Below is applied language setting precedence:

   |language-precedence|

If user email language setting is application default, language would be applied by application email language setting.

If user selects a language in email setting, language would be appplied by this selection.

To configure languages of Portal applications, refer to :ref:`language-settings`.

-  For multiple languages, the CMS key ``/AppInfo/SupportedLanguages``
   must exist in your application. This CMS entry is
   in Portal Style. It contains list of all languages supported by
   your application, separated by comma.

   -  Must not contain spaces
   -  Same as display name of Locale
   -  Separated by comma
   -  Process model version, which has this CMS, must active

-  To add new language to Portal, what you have to do is

   -  Add new language locale to cms entry of Portal Style ``/AppInfo/SupportedLanguages`` 
   -  Export all CMS entries of Portal Style to excel file
   -  Add translation of new language for all CMS entries
   -  Import file excel back, then redeploy Portal Style
   -  This is sample how to add new Spanish to portal

Virus Scanning Setting 
======================

PrimeFaces is delivered with one implementation of that interface that uses
`VirusTotal <https://www.virustotal.com/>`_. To enable `VirusTotal
<https://www.virustotal.com/>`_ you need to create a community account at the
`VirusTotal website <https://www.virustotal.com/>`_. You receive an API key once
you have an account. To configure the API key add the following snippet to the
configuration/web.xml file:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <context-param>
      <param-name>primefaces.virusscan.VIRUSTOTAL_KEY</param-name>
      <param-value>PUT YOUR API KEY HERE</param-value> 
      </context-param>

   ..

By default after configured context-param in the web XML file, the Virus
Scanning is disabled. You could update the value of the variable
``ENABLE_VIRUS_SCANNER_FOR_UPLOADED_DOCUMENT`` to ``true`` in ``portal_settings_config.properties`` that
you want to enable.
