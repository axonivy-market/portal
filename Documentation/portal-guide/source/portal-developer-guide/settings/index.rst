Setup Global settings by configuration file
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Setup Portal multi applications
-------------------------------

Portal provides two types of multi applications: ``Multi applications with overview`` and ``Multi applications (without overview)``

Multi applications with overview
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. important::

   Used for related applications App1, App2, App3... of which we need to see all
   tasks/cases in one page. Task/Case list of application named ``Portal`` would display all
   tasks/cases of applications App1, App2, App3...

|multi-application-with-portal|


-  Create a new application named ``Portal``. Deploy portal (kit,
   template ..) to this application.

-  Create new applications: App1, App2, App3... Deploy portal
   (kit, template ..) to new applications.

-  Configure multi-apps Portal: login by Portal
   Admin, configure applications: App1,
   App2, App3...

-  Note that, ``do not`` add the application named ``Portal``, it is reserved
   for displaying all tasks/cases... from all configured
   applications.

-  Dashboard menu is only visible when logged-in user exists in
   Portal application.

Multi applications (without overview)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. important::

   Used for independent applications App1, App2, App3... of which we ``do not`` need to see all
   tasks/cases in one page.


|multi-application-without-portal|

-  Create new applications: App1, App2, App3... Deploy portal(kit,
   template ..) to new applications. Note: must not create an
   application named ``Portal``.

-  Configure multi-apps Portal: login by Portal
   Admin, configure applications: App1,
   App2, App3...

How to add a new application
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Choose ``Application`` tab on ``Admin Settings`` dialog and click on
``New`` button to add new application. Here you can choose application
type either as Ivy application or Third Party application.

|multi-portal-add-application|

.. tip::

   -  ``Application name`` is the name of the application when you
      create it. ``Display name`` is the name of the application to be
      shown on Portal UI.

   -  ``Portal link`` specifies the link will be redirected when
      selecting the application on the application menu. It could be an
      absolute link (e.g.
      http://10.123.1.30:8000/ivy/pro/.../DefaultApplicationHomePage.ivp) or relative
      link (e.g. /ivy/pro/.../DefaultApplicationHomePage.ivp). If your application
      could be accessed from multiple domains, use relative link so that
      you can access the link from different domains.

   -  For multiple languages of application display name, you need to
      create the "AppInfo/SupportedLanguages" CMS which defines how many
      languages your application supports. See the below "Language
      settings" for more details.

.. _settings-language:

Language settings
=================

-  Below is applied language setting precedence:

   |language-precedence|

   If user email language setting is application default, language would
   be applied by application email language setting.

   If user selects a language in email setting, language would be
   appplied by this selection.

-  To configure languages of Portal applications, select
   ``Language Settings`` in ``User Settings`` .

-  UI reads current languages settings for all applications.

-  To change language for application, select one in the languages
   dropdown list of application. When the change is saved, the language
   will be set for application (Click on the application in header menu
   to reload application and see the change of language).

   |language-settings|

-  For multiple languages, the CMS key ``/AppInfo/SupportedLanguages``
   must exist in your application. From Portal 7.1, this CMS entry is
   moved to Portal Style. It contains list of all languages supported by
   your application, separated by comma.

   -  Must not contain spaces
   -  Same as display name of Locale
   -  Separated by comma
   -  Process model version, which has this CMS, must active

-  To add new language to Portal, what you have to do is

   -  Add new language locale to cms entry of Portal Style ``/AppInfo/SupportedLanguages`` 
   -  Export all CMS entries of Portal Style to excel file
   -  Add translation of new language for all CMS entries
   -  Import file excel back, then redeploy Portal Style
   -  This is sample how to add new Spanish to portal
