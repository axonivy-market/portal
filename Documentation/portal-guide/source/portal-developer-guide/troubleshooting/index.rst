IE Security Problem
===================

If you start Portal in Internet Explorer installed on Windows Server
then Portal application may not work correctly. The reason could be
**Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration** is enabled by
default which means ActiveX Controls and scripting are disabled, so
Internet sites may not display in Internet Explorer as you expect.

To fix this, you may turn off **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security
Configuration** if you are running in Windows Server. Another way is
adding that site to the Trusted sites zone in Internet Explorer.

Portal install with IIS
=======================

It could be a problem when install Portal with IIS with proxy, depends
on your environment. Consider to configure if your IIS is called via
proxy. Add ``-Dhttp.proxyHost`` to ``VM argument`` could help.

Update default pages
====================
If you copy ``PortalStart.mod`` to your project for customization, 
you need to follow this chapter to customize standard processes in your designer and engine:
:dev-url:`Standard Processes </doc/9.3.5/designer-guide/user-interface/standard-processes/index.html>`

For example, below is the default setting:

.. literalinclude:: files/app-designer.yaml
  :language: yaml

And your Portal project has different package and name, such as: ``com.example:customizedPortal``. Then you can change the configuration as below:

.. literalinclude:: files/app-designer-customized.yaml
  :language: yaml
