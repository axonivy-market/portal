Portal Installation with Reverse Proxy
======================================

If you install the Portal in an environment that uses a reverse proxy (Nginx,
IIS or Apache httpd), you have to define the proxy in the Axon Ivy Engine
configuration.

Update Default Pages
====================
If you copy ``PortalStart.p.json`` to your project for customization, you need
to follow this chapter to customize the default pages in your designer and
engine: :dev-url:`Default Pages </doc/10.0.1.1/designer-guide/user-interface/default-pages/index.html>`

For example, if you start with the default settings:

.. literalinclude:: files/app-designer.yaml
  :language: yaml

and your Portal project has a different package and name, such as:
``com.example:customizedPortal``, then you have to change the configuration as
shown below:

.. literalinclude:: files/app-designer-customized.yaml
  :language: yaml
