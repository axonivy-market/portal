New & Noteworthy 9.3
--------------------

Customizable Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
End-users can choose between different layouts, 
enable and disable default columns and even add custom columns at will.

|customizable-dashboard|

This feature allows multiple task lists with different filter options. 
For example, separating HR tasks from Finance tasks provides a better overview and more transparency.

Default Widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Axon Ivy Portal supports a sophisticated concept featuring default widgets for Process Starts, Task Lists, and Case Lists.

|default-widgets|

Processes, tasks, and cases are essential when it comes to business process automation and workflow management. Therefore, the Axon Ivy Portal gives you full power by providing these standard widgets out-of-the-box.

|default-widgets-configuration|

Each configuration is intuitive, and users can make their settings meticulously.

Custom Widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Individuality is king. End-users can easily create custom widgets in the dashboard.

|custom-widgets|

There are two different widgets types available:

- Axon Ivy Process
- External URL

An external URL embeds the corresponding website into your dashboard. This feature is helpful to integrate enterprise content management systems or knowledge sites.

Specify your Axon Ivy Process as a widget element and display your process directly in your custom dashboard.

Adjustable Look for Process List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switch between an image, grid, and compact mode to display available processes.

|adjustable-look-for-process-list|

A picture says a thousand words. This saying is true and applies to business processes. The requirements of end-users must be met. The process starts with image support to contribute to a beautiful appearance and help work quickly and purposefully.
