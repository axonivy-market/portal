Migration notes
===============

This document informs you in detail about incompatibilities that were
introduced between Portal versions and tells you what needs to be done
to make your existing Portal working with current Axon Ivy Engine.

How to migrate
--------------
   
.. important:: 
   If you call any Portal API which is not mentioned in the document. It could be changed or removed without inform. Don't forget
   to re-implement the concerning API in your own project.

   In order to migrate Portal, you need to migrate Axon Ivy, refer
   `Axon Ivy migration
   notes <https://developer.axonivy.com/doc/8.0/engine-guide/installation/upgrade.html>`__.
   Changes in Axon Ivy could lead to problems if customer project is not
   migrated properly.

In designer
-----------

1. Replace all Portal projects
2. Update PortalTemplate dependency of customer project in pom.xml.
3. If PortalStyle is customized, copy logo, customization.scss,
   font-faces.scss, customized stuff from old to new PortalStyle, run
   maven to compile CSS.
4. Follow detailed migration notes for each version below.
5. If customization needs copying code from Portal, merge changes
   between two versions of Portal for copied code.

..

In engine
---------

1. Convert database schema if needed.
2. If your ivy version is before 7.3.0 : deactivate standard Portal
   application if it's not needed.
3. Redeploy Portal projects (exclude PortalConnector) and customer
   project.
4. Follow detailed migration notes for each version below.

Migrate 8.0.x to 8.0.19

-----------------------

1. When a task is finished, Portal could show a link to case details in Global Growl. Due to this new feature, PortalStart.mod file is changed. If you have

Portal Template to your project and re-apply your customization.


Migrate 8.0.7 to 8.0.11
-----------------------

1. Since 8.0.11, statistic chart has multiple names for supported languages in application. Therefore you must run a migration process by the following steps:

   - Deploy :download:`MigrateStatisticChartTo8.iar <documents/MigrateStatisticChartTo8.iar>` project to your Ivy application. This project requires ``PortalKit`` to run.

   - Run ``MigrateStatisticChart/MigrateStatisticChart.ivp`` to migrate all statistic charts in your application.

   - Restart Ivy engine.

Migrate 8.0.x to 8.0.7

remove old implementation and adapt it accordingly.

2. In this Portal version, we introduced ``External link`` as a process item in Full Process List.
You need to migrate external links for all users in User Favorites to Full Process List. 
Please deploy :download:`ExternalLinkMigration.iar <documents/ExternalLinkMigration.iar>` project 
then run ``migrateExternalLinkFromUserFavorites.ivp``
and wait until it is redirected to another page without error (E.g: Homepage).

Migrate 8.0.0 to 8.0.1
----------------------

PortalStart.mod file is changed. If you have
customized this process in your project, copy new PortalStart from
Portal Template to your project and re-apply your customization.

PortalStart.ivp is removed, if you use it to configure the start link in application registration, change it to DefaultApplicationHomePage.ivp

:ref:`Non-ajax handling <components-error-handling-nonajax-error-handling>` is changed. Follow the instructions and reconfigure it.
