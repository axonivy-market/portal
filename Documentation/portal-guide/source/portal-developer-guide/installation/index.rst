Basic Installation
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Axon Ivy Designer or Engine
- Understanding of :ref:`Portal architecture <architecture>`
- For production: Valid Axon Ivy Engine license

Portal Modules
--------------

The Portal application consists of 2 process modules:

.. table::
   :widths: 30 70

   +-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | Module                  | Purpose                                                   |
   +=========================+===========================================================+
   | **portal-components**   | Public UI components and APIs for reuse                   |
   +-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | **portal**              | Portal-specific UI, templates, and pages                  |
   +-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

For detailed module information, refer to :ref:`architecture`.

For project deployment procedures, see :dev-url:`project deployment </doc/12.0/engine-guide/deployment/index.html>`.

Installation by Environment
---------------------------

Designer
^^^^^^^^

Import Portal modules (portal and portal-components) to your Axon Ivy Designer.

Demo Mode (Engine Without License)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The engine automatically deploys the Portal application with pre-configured demo users:

.. table::
   :widths: 20 20 60

   +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Username              | Password              | Description                                   |
   +=======================+=======================+===============================================+
   | **admin**             | admin                 | Full Portal permissions, can access           |
   |                       |                       | Admin Settings                                |
   +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | **demo**              | demo                  | Can manage user absences                      |
   +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | **guest**             | guest                 | Standard Portal user                          |
   +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

.. warning::
   Demo users are for development/testing only. Do not use in production environments.

Production Mode (Engine With License)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The engine does not deploy Portal automatically. You must deploy and configure Portal manually.

Dashboard Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the Dashboard JSON configuration file to your Axon Ivy Engine, choose one of these methods:

**Method 1: Include in app.zip (Recommended)**

Include the Dashboard.json file in your app.zip under ``<app.zip>/config/variables/Portal.Dashboard.json``:

.. code-block:: text

   app.zip
   ├── config
   │   ├── app.yaml
   │   └── variables
   │       └── Portal.Dashboard.json
   ├── portal.iar
   └── portal-components.iar

.. important::
   The JSON file must be named ``Portal.Dashboard.json``.

See :dev-url:`Engine Deployment </doc/12.0/engine-guide/deployment/index.html>` for details.

**Method 2: Copy to Application Folder**

Copy the Dashboard.json file directly to: ``<engine>/configuration/applications/<application>/variables.Portal.Dashboard.json``

.. note::
   The file must be named ``variables.Portal.Dashboard.json`` when using this method.

**Method 3: Use Portal Import Feature**

Use the Portal's import dashboard feature. See :ref:`How to import your public dashboards <howto-import-your-public-dashboards>`.

Multi-Application Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configuration displays unified task lists across multiple applications within the same security context.

.. important::
   The Portal running in a security context displays Task/Case lists from all applications in that context.

**Architecture:**

- **Application 1 (Portal)**: portal + portal-components  
- **Application 2+ (Your Apps)**: your projects + portal-components (only if using Portal UI components)

All applications must be in the same security context. Deploy **portal-components** to your custom applications only if you need to use Portal UI components or APIs. See :ref:`The Portal multi-application setup <multi-app-structure>` for details.

**HowTo: Set Up Multi-Application Deployment**

#. Create a new application for Portal

#. Deploy both Portal modules (portal and portal-components) to this application

#. Create additional applications for your projects (App1, App2, etc.)

#. Deploy your projects to these applications

#. (Optional) Add portal-components as a dependency if you want to reuse Portal UI components in your applications

#. Verify all applications are in the same security context

#. Deploy your projects along with portal-components to these applications

#. Verify all applications are in the same security context

Migration Notes
===============

This document informs you in detail about incompatibilities that were
introduced between Portal versions and tells you what needs to be done
to make your existing Portal working with current Axon Ivy Engine.

How To Migrate
--------------

.. important::
   If you call any Portal API which is not mentioned in the API documentation,
   it may have changed or have been removed. Don't forget to re-implement the
   APIs concerned in your own project.

   To migrate the Portal, you need to migrate Axon Ivy first. Refer to the
   :dev-url:`Axon Ivy Migration Notes
   </doc/12.0/axonivy/migration/index.html>`. Changes in Axon Ivy could lead
   to problems if a customer project is not migrated properly.

In Designer
-----------

#. Replace all Portal projects with the versions of the new release.
#. Upgrade your projects to use the latest portal version by using the **Convert Project** feature. Please find more information here: :dev-url:`Converting Projects </doc/12.0/designer-guide/process-modeling/projects/converting.html#converting-projects>`
#. Follow detailed migration notes for each version below.
#. If customization needs copying code from Portal, merge changes between the
   two versions of the Portal for copied code.

..

In Engine
---------

#. Convert database schema if needed.

#. Redeploy Portal projects and customer project.

#. Follow detailed migration notes for each version below.

Migrate 11.3.2 To 12.0.0
------------------------

1. Custom field values for business details pages are migrated silently from the process link relative path 
to its :dev-url:`IWebStartable ID </doc/12.0/public-api/ch/ivyteam/ivy/workflow/start/IWebStartable.html#getId()>`.
You don't need to do anything, this is just for your information.

2. We implemented a new feature to adjusting column widths in the Task and Case widgets.
This change may slightly impact the column widths of Task and Case widgets from previous versions.
To manually adjust column widths, please refer to the :ref:`Task widget configuraiton <new-dashboard-task-list-widget>`,
and :ref:`Case widget configuraiton <new-dashboard-case-list-widget>` guides.

Migrate 11.1.0 To 11.2.0
------------------------

The ``AxonIvyExpress`` module is renamed to ``axonivy-express`` and becomes an item on the Axon Ivy Market, To migrate it you need to do the following steps:

- Open **Portal**, go to **Setting** -> **Express Management**. Export all Express configurations.
- Open the **Cockpit**, stop the PM **AxonIvyExpress** in your **Portal** application.
- Deploy the **axonivy-express** module which gets from the Axon Ivy Market into the **Portal** application.
- Restart Engine.
- Open **Portal**, go to **Setting** -> **Express Management**. Import the configuration which is exported at the first step.


- If you override ``PortalStartTimeCleanObsoletedDataExpression`` variable, please update it to new Ivy CRON job pattern.
- Refer to Axon Ivy CRON job pattern: `CRON Expression <https://developer.axonivy.com/doc/12.0/engine-guide/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#cron-expression>`_.
- Example: Change ``0 0 1 * * ?`` to ``0 1 * * *`` for job trigger 01:00 AM everyday.

Migrate 10.0.19 To 10.0.20
--------------------------

So far, Portal supports configuring process steps of :ref:`Process chain <components-portal-components-process-chain>` with String or Array format. 
We deprecated the String format but still support it for backward compatibility. We recommend you use the Array format. You could change as follows:

- Change ``window.processSteps = "Create Investment Request,Approve Investment Request";`` to ``window.processSteps = ["Create Investment Request", "Approve Investment Request"];``

- Change ``window.processSteps = "#{fn:join(data.steps.toArray(), ',')}";`` to ``window.processSteps = #{portalComponentUtilsBean.convertToJSON(data.steps)};``

Migrate 10.0.12 To 10.0.13
--------------------------

- Override HTML dialog ``UserWithEnvironmentInfo`` is removed and no longer supported, use ``GlobalFooterInfo`` dialog instead with the GlobalVariable.

- Override HTML dialog ``PageHeader`` and ``PageFooter`` are no longer supported, use callable instead.

Migrate 10.0.11 To 10.0.12
--------------------------

1. Portal no longer supports the override process approach for some subprocesses. Please follow the guidelines below to migrate your override subprocesses.

   - :ref:`Customize Forgot Password <customization-forgot-password>`
      - Remove subprocess override of ``ResetPassword`` and ``SendPasswordResetEmail``` from your project.

         | LoadSubMenuItems        | portalLoadSubMenuItems        |
         +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
      - To hide default menu items, you can utilize variables. Here's a link :ref:`Show/hide default menu items <customization-menu-hide-default-menu-item>` that provides instructions on how to do so.
      - Update ``index`` for each custom menu item.
      - Refer to process ``CustomLoadSubMenuItems`` in the project ``portal-developer-examples`` for an example of how to create custom menu items.

2. We changed the **External Link** configuration for the field ``imageContent``, refer to :ref:`Portal Processes External Links <portal-process-external-link>` for more information. Basically, you do not need any migration on your engine. In case you have overridden the variable `Portal.Processes.ExternalLinks` by deployment, update the field ``imageContent`` by removing the prefix like `data:image/jpeg;base64,` in your JSON variable `Portal.Processes.ExternalLinks` file.

Migrate 10.0 To 10.0.7
----------------------

The ``ch.ivy.addon.portalkit.publicapi.PortalNavigatorInFrameAPI`` class is removed and no longer supported, use 
``com.axonivy.portal.components.util.PortalNavigatorInFrameAPI`` instead.

Migrate 8.x To 10.0
-------------------

You need to do all steps starting at ``Migrate 8.x To ...`` up to and including
``Migrate ... To 9.x``

Migrate 9.3 To 9.4
------------------

``PortalStyle``, ``PortalKit`` and ``PortalTemplate`` have been replaced by ``portal-components`` and ``portal`` from 9.4, refer to :ref:`architecture`.

#. If you have customized PortalStyle, please refer to
   :ref:`Customization Portal Logos And Colors <customization-portal-logos-and-colors>` to override login background, favicon & logo images.
   If you have changed the CMS in ``PortalStyle``, please adapt the ``portal`` CMS accordingly.

#. The ``customization.css`` file has been removed, in case you use it in your project, please switch to using
   :dev-url:`Engine Branding </doc/12.0/designer-guide/user-interface/branding/branding-engine.html>` to customize styling

#. Subprocesses related to documents are moved to the independent project ``portal-components``.
   If you customized these processes, please override the correspond subprocess again and added your customization to it.

   Below is a list of deprecated processes in project ``portal`` and new processes in project ``portal-components``.

   +-----------------------------------+--------------------------+
   | New subprocess                    | Deprecated subprocess    |
   +===================================+==========================+
   | GetDocumentItems                  | GetDocumentList          |

   +-----------------------------------+--------------------------+
   | DownloadDocumentItem              | DownloadDocument         |
   +-----------------------------------+--------------------------+

#. Some classes of the Portal have been moved to the independent project ``portal-components``. Please refer to below table to migrate them correctly

   .. csv-table::
      :file: documents/class_replacement_9.4.csv
      :header-rows: 1
      :class: longtable
      :widths: 1 1

#. Some components of the Portal have been moved to the independent project ``portal-components``. Please follow these steps to migrate them:

   - :ref:`Migration steps <components-portal-components-migrate-from-old-user-selection>` for the new :ref:`User Selection <components-portal-components-user-selection>` component.

   - :ref:`Migration steps <components-portal-components-migrate-from-old-role-selection>` for the new :ref:`Role Selection <components-portal-components-role-selection>` component.

   - :ref:`Migration steps <components-portal-components-migrate-from-old-document-table>` for the new :ref:`Document Table <components-portal-components-document-table>` component.

   - :ref:`Migration steps <components-portal-components-migrate-from-old-process-chain>` for the new :ref:`Process Chain <components-portal-components-process-chain>` component.

#. Portal dashboard widgets only support the ``CustomFields`` declared in the ``custom-fields.yaml`` file.
   If your ``CustomFields`` are used in the dashboard widget, please follow the :dev-url:`Custom Fields Meta Information </doc/12.0/designer-guide/how-to/workflow/custom-fields.html#meta-information>` to adapt the data.

#. The ``DefaultChartColor.p.json`` subprocess has been removed, in case you use it in your project, please remove override this subprocess and switch to using
   :dev-url:`Engine Branding </doc/12.0/designer-guide/user-interface/branding/branding-engine.html>` to customize chart, data labels, legend color.

#. Deploy :download:`portal-migration-9.4.0.iar <documents/portal-migration-9.4-9.4.0.iar>` project to your Ivy application and run it by access link
   ``your_host/your_application/pro/portal-migration/175F92F71BC45295/startMigrateConfiguration.ivp``

   .. important::
      * If you have many applications, deploy to only one application and run it by access the migration link,
        for example: ``https://portal.io/Portal/pro/portal-migration/175F92F71BC45295/startMigrateConfiguration.ivp``

      * Use an administrator account to sign in
      * Run migration process only once
      * You must remove some process models: ``portal-migration``, ``PortalStyle``, ``PortalKit`` and ``PortalTemplate`` after successfully migrating.

Migrate 9.2 To 9.3
------------------

#. Deploy :download:`portal-migration.iar <documents/portal-migration-9.3.0.iar>` project to your Ivy application and run it by access link
   ``your_host/your_application/pro/portal-migration/175F92F71BC45295/startMigrateConfiguration.ivp``

   .. important::
      * If you have many applications, deploy to only one application and run it by access the migration link,
        for example: ``https://portal.io/Portal/pro/portal-migration/175F92F71BC45295/startMigrateConfiguration.ivp``

      * Use an administrator account to sign in
      * Run migration process only once

#. We changed the way to navigate to Task Analysis component. Process ``Start Processes/TaskAnalysis/start.ivp`` is moved to new place ``Start Processes/PortalStart/showTaskAnalysis.ivp``.

#. We moved the configuration of announcement, thirdparty applications, default statistic charts, application favorite processes, public external links and express processes from the BusinessData tovariables.

#. Copy the PortalStart process from PortalTemplate to your project because we changed something relate to DefaultApplicationHomePage.ivp and PortalDashboardConfiguration.ivp.
   Then apply your customization to the PortalStart in your project.

#. Portal date filter such as TaskCreationDateFilter, CaseCreationDateFilter... messages ``<p:messages for="..." />`` have been added for each calendar component to validate date format.
   If you use have any customized date filters in your project, update template accordingly.

#. The callable process ``DefaultChart.p.json``, ``DefaultUserProcess.p.json`` has been removed. They are replaced by
   the :dev-url:`Variables </doc/12.0/designer-guide/configuration/variables.html>` configuration approach.
   

Migrate 9.1 To 9.2
------------------

#. Deploy :download:`MigrateData.iar <documents/MigrateData.iar>` project to your Ivy application and run it by access link
   ``your_host/your_application/pro/MigrateData/175F92F71BC45295/startMigrateConfiguration.ivp``

   If you have many applications, deploy to only one application and run it by access link
   ``your_host/your_application/pro/MigrateData/175F92F71BC45295/startMigrateConfiguration.ivp``

   Example: ``https://portal.io/Portal/pro/MigrateData/175F92F71BC45295/startMigrateConfiguration.ivp``

   .. important:: Run migration process only once

#. We remove implementation of Portal multiple applications. So that you need to adapt some points below:

   - Adapt start process signature of ``PasswordService`` in ``ChangePassword.mod`` if you overrode this callable.
   - If you are using ``ProcessStartCollector``, replace constructor ``ProcessStartCollector(application)`` with ``ProcessStartCollector()``.
   - If you have TaskLazyDataModel, CaseLazyDataModel customization, remove ``setInvolvedApplications()`` method, ``setInvolvedUsername`` in search criteria.

#. In PortalNavigatorInFrame.java, change the methods from non-static to static.

#. CaseDetails component in PortalTemplate is removed.

#. Deprecated callable processes: ``OpenPortalSearch.mod``, ``OpenPortalTasks.mod``, ``OpenPortalTaskDetails.mod``, ``OpenPortalCases.mod``, ``OpenPortalCaseDetails.mod`` process.

   Portal recommends using :dev-url:`Axon Ivy HtmlOverride wizard </doc/12.0/designer-guide/how-to/overrides.html?#override-new-wizard>` to customize ``Portal HTML Dialog``

   .. important:: The callable process which is supporting to open customization dialog will be removed in the future, do not use it in the new project

#. We remove ivy-icon.css and replace current classes with new classes from Streamline icons, which can be found in the `HTML Dialog Demo <https://market.axonivy.com/html-dialog-demo>`_. So that you need to update your files that are using classes in ivy-icon.css.

#. If you have taskItemDetailCustomPanelTop, taskItemDetailCustomPanelBottom customization, follow :ref:`How to override TaskItemDetail <customization-task-item-details>` to add custom widgets.

9. If you have ``caseItemDetailCustomTop`` or ``caseItemDetailCustomMiddle`` or ``caseItemDetailCustomBottom`` customization, follow :ref:`How to override CaseItemDetail <customization-case-item-details>` to add these custom widgets.

Migrate 8.x To 9.1
------------------

#. Remove the ``views`` field in SubMenuItem.java. Adapt it if you overrode the ``LoadSubMenuItems`` callable process

#. Add parameter ``<ui:param name="viewName" value="TASK" />`` to your customized ``PortalTasksTemplate`` to displayed breadcrumb of Task list.

#. Add parameter ``<ui:param name="viewName" value="CASE" />`` to your customized ``PortalCasesTemplate`` to displayed breadcrumb of Case list.

#. Ivy core has enhanced the Ivy URI, so Portal needs to make a migration. For
   each of your applications, execute the following steps:

   #. Deploy process model :download:`PortalUrlMigration.iar <documents/PortalUrlMigration.iar>`
      to your Ivy Application.

   #. run ``migratePortalUrl.ivp`` once and wait until it is redirected to
      another page (i.e. the Homepage) without error.

   #. Remove the process model ``migratePortalUrl.ivp`` after successfully migrating.

#. HOMEPAGE_URL (single Portal app mode) and registered application link (multi
   Portal app mode) are not available anymore. To let Portal know where your new
   Portal home page is, you have to set default pages in your project.
   Follow this chapter to customize default-pages:
   :dev-url:`Default Pages </doc/12.0/designer-guide/user-interface/default-pages/index.html>`

#. Portal now uses |css_variable| instead of SASS. Therefore, you have to convert
   the SASS syntax to the new CSS variables or use online tools such as
   |css_variable_convert| to convert it.

#. If the Engine Administrator activates the ``Portal.Cases.EnableOwner``
   setting and you have a customized case list, customize this field to this

#. Starting in 9.1, the Ivy engine uses a new mechanism to synchronize user
   data. Therefore, the Portal has to adapt some data related to users. Some
   data has to be migrated to work properly. Please follow these steps to
   migrate the existing data of your application:

   - Deploy process model :download:`MigrateRelatedDataOfUserTo9.iar
     <documents/MigrateRelatedDataOfUserTo9.iar>` to your application.

   - Run ``migratePrivateChat.ivp`` to migrate private chat messages.

   - Run ``migrateGroupChat.ivp`` to migrate group chat.

   - Run ``migrateUserProcessesAndExternalLinks.ivp`` to migrate user processes
     and external links.

   - Run ``migrateExpressProcesses.ivp`` to migrate Express processes. Please
     skip this step if your application does not include Express.

   - Restart Ivy engine.

#. Use ``pageContent`` to define your section in ``BasicTemplate.xhtml`` instead of ``simplePageContent``.

#. ``TaskTemplate-7`` has been removed, change it to ``TaskTemplate-8``. ``TaskTemplate`` has been removed, too, change it to ``frame-8`` (provided by Ivy).

#. The ``MenuKind`` enum has one more entry: EXTERNAL_LINK. Use it if your item
   is an external link. Use CUSTOM if it is an internal link.

#. The ``PortalNavigatorInFrameAPI#navigateToPortalHome`` method is deprecated,
   redirect to ivy.html.applicationHomeRef() in your page instead.
