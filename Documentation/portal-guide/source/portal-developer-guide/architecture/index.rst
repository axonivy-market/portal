.. important::
      The CSS styles, Java methods, etc. which are not explicitly documented are
      only used internally in Portal. Don't use them because they can be
      changed in future versions.

The Portal system consists of the following modules: portal-components, portal and AxonIvyExpress.
While AxonIvyExpress is optional, all other modules are mandatory.

.. _architecture-portal-components:

portal-components
=================

**Contains a set of public UI components**

This module contains Ivy components such as User Selection, Role Selection,
Document Table, Process Chain, Process History, and Process Viewer,... These components are independent
of the modules portal and AxonIvyExpress. You can use them in your own applications.

.. _architecture-portal:

portal
======

**Contains portal specific UI components, templates and pages**

The module ``portal`` provides a set of specific UI components that you need
to use and administer (or manage) the portal, templates for developer and portal pages.

The templates offer features like top
menu, application menu and user menu. It also contains start process links to
default pages like Portal home, Portal task list, Portal case list etc..
We advise developers to depend on this module to facilitate Portal customization.

.. _architecture-axonivy-express:

AxonIvyExpress
==============

**No Code Process Management**

This tool set allows end users to create their own processes and manage them easily.
It gives users more flexibility when working with the Portal.

This project has been extended from portal. It allows the end user to

-  Create his own workflow
-  Create and modify a web form for this workflow

|ivy| Express also provides an AdHoc process feature. When Express is deployed, users can start an AdHoc process from any task.
Adhoc allows users to define additional process steps which will be executed before the current task.
