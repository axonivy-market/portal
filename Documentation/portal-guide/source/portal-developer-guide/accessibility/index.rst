Accessibility
*************

Introduction
------------
This section introduces some basic considerations to help you get started making
all Portal sites more accessible to people with disabilities. These tips are
good practice to help you meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
requirements.

Color Contrast
--------------
To ensure that all Portal sites are accessible and easy to see, foreground text
needs to have sufficient contrast with background colors. This helps users with
limited vision and those viewing the content in bright environments, like under
sunlight, to clearly perceive the information.

We measure contrast between text or graphic against the background color. This
is called contrast ratio. For accessibility purposes, aim for a 4.5:1 ratio
between the foreground color (e.g. text, links, etc.) and the background color.
