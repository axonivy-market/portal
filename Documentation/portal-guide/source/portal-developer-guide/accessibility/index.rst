Introduction

Here is the Accessibility collection for the Axon Ivy Portal.
It provides tools and settings designed to enhance your experience and make it more inclusive, regardless of your abilities.
In this section, you will find features such as screen reader support, keyboard navigation via shortcuts, and text resizing.
Explore the collection to optimize your use of the Axon Ivy Portal and enjoy a more comfortable user experience.

Color Contrast
--------------
To ensure that all Portal sites are accessible and easy to see, text and
graphical elements should have high contrast. This helps users with limited
vision and those viewing the content in bright environments, like under
sunlight, to clearly perceive the information.

We measure contrast between text or graphic against the background color. This
is called contrast ratio. For accessibility purposes, aim for a 4.5:1 ratio
between the foreground color (e.g. text, links, etc.) and the background color.
