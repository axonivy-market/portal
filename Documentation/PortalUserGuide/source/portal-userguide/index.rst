Axon.ivy Portal
******************
   
The :guilabel:`Axon.ivy Portal` is the centerpiece for your daily work with the
applications you / your company implemented using the Axon.ivy Digital Business
Platform. With a web-based, modern interface the Portal provides you with key
functionalities on all your devices:

-  Access your / your company’s applications and start new cases

-  Manage and fulfil tasks assigned to you or your roles

-  Understand what’s going on by using on-the-spot statistics and
   historic data on all your cases and tasks

-  Improve your Axon.ivy Portal experience and efficiency through the
   built-in customization options

This document provides you – as a business user – with a comprehensive
overview about the Axon.ivy Portal, its features and functionalities.

.. Hint::
	The look and feel shown in the screenshots of this document, as well as the
	presented features are part of the default standard Axon.ivy Portal. However,
	the Axon.ivy Portal is highly configurable, thus your company’s portal might
	have a different look and feel, and some features might be disabled by your
	administrator.

To start your Axon.ivy Portal experience, use the link provided to you by your
administrator. Following the link, the Axon.ivy Portal will ask for your login
credentials.

.. Hint:: 
   Depending on your company’s infrastructure, you might be automatically logged in
   by the single-sign-on (SSO). In this case you’ll directly be forwarded to the
   Axon.ivy Portal Dashboard. 

After successful login, you’ll see the Axon.ivy Portal Homepage and your
personal dashboard. All your activities can be managed from this central entry
point. In detail these are:
   
   1. The Axon.ivy Portal header on the top is always visible and provides
      you with a global search, key information about the portal and options to
      configure your personal user account. See chapter 3 Portal Header for
      details.
   
   2. The menu on the left side is always available and gives you access to
      all processes, cases, tasks and other features of the Axon.ivy Portal. You
      may enlarge or minimise the menu using the |image5| **Toggle Menu** button
      in the top left corner.
   
   3. In the center you see your personal dashboard providing you instant
      access to your processes, tasks and performance indicators. See
      `Dashboard`_ for a detailed introduction.

   1. The :guilabel:`Processes`  section on the left side. Here you find and
      manage quick links to the processes you use most often in your daily work. The
      section Processes is described in detail `Process Favorites`_.

   2. The :guilabel:`Tasks`  section in the center. Here you see all the open tasks
      assigned to your or your organizational unit. These tasks require
      your personal attention. The section is described in detail `Personal Tasks`_.

   3. The :guilabel:`Statistics` section on the right side. The charts in this
      section provide you with basic information on the performance of your

Process Favorites
-----------------

The process favorites you find under the heading :guilabel:`Processes` on the
left side of your dashboard. They provide you with a quick and easy access to
the processes you need most in your daily work. Therefore, the process favorites
are a key feature to enhance your Axon.ivy Portal experience and increase your
efficiency. To make full use of this feature the Axon.ivy Portal offers you an
easy way to configure the process favorites to your personal needs. This is
described later in this chapter. 

|image11|

.. centered::  Process favorites

When you have a look at the process favorites you see two areas:

-  On the top you find the :guilabel:`User Favorites` which you need to
   configure before you can use them. You may add processes here as well
   as external links.

-  Below you find the :guilabel:`Application Favorites`. They are centrally
   configured by your administrator. Therefore, you may use but not
   change them.

Furthermore, next to the heading you find a link :guilabel:`Show all processes`.
This quick link routes you the **Full Process List** page of the
Axon.ivy Portal. Please refer to `Full Process List`_ for more detail detailed information.

Personal Tasks
--------------

The personal tasks you find under the heading :guilabel:`Tasks` in the center of
your dashboard. You see here all tasks that are assigned to you or any of the
roles you hold within the application. Therefore, this section is key in
understanding your workload within the application. You may pick up any task
from the task list and start working on it.

|image24|

.. centered:: Personal Tasks

At first glance, you see the number of tasks right next to the heading
:guilabel:`Tasks`. Further to the right you find the link **Show full task
list**. This quick link routes you to the :guilabel:`Task List` page of the
Axon.ivy Portal. Please refer to `Full Task List`_ for more
detailed information.

Right below the heading :guilabel:`Task` you find the following features which
support you in finding the correct tasks:

1. With the link Sort by priority you can sort the task list from the
   highest to the lowest priority.

2. With the link Sort by expiry time you can sort the task list
   according to the time left until the task expires.

3. On the right side of the Tasks section you find a search box. The
   Axon.ivy Portal searches for your keyword in the task ID, name and
   description of the tasks in your task list.

.. image:: media/image26.png

.. centered:: Personal tasks sort and search features

Each task in your task list has an own entry. The entry provides you
with key information about the task allowing you an easy identification.
The following information can be found in the task entries:

1. The :guilabel:`Task Priority`

2. The :guilabel:`Task Name` 

3. The :guilabel:`Task ID` 

4. The ::guilabel:`Creation Date`

5. The :guilabel:`Expiry Date` which is the due date until when the task should
   be completed.

Statistics
----------

The statistics you find under the heading :guilabel:`Statistics` on the
right-hand side of your dashboard. The charts in this section allow you to grasp
the overall situation at a glance.

|image27|

.. centered:: Dashboard statistics section

Next to the heading you find a link **Show all charts**. This quick link
routes you the :guilabel:`Statistics` page of the Axon.ivy Portal. Please refer
to `Full Statistics page`_  for more detailed information.

Within the green header of the chart, you find two navigation buttons
(|image28|, |image29|) allowing you to toggle between the available
charts. Each chart then provides you with the following information:

1. The :guilabel:`Chart Title` , helping you to understand the content of the
   chart

2. The :guilabel:`Chart` itself, which gives you a graphical representation of
   the data. Furthermore, you see the exact figures in the chart as
   well.

3. The :guilabel:`Legend` explains the different elements of the charts.

.. image:: media/image33.png

.. centered:: Statistics key information

If you require more or different charts, you need to create them first.
Chapter `HowTo: Create chart`_ explains in detail how to create new
charts.

Portal Header
*************

The Axon.ivy Portal header is always visible. On the top right of the
header you find two very useful features:

1. The name of the user you’re logged in with. Additionally, if you
   click on your username you get a menu with options that allow you to
   configure the Axon.ivy Portal to your personal needs. See `User Settings in
   the Axon.ivy Portal`_ for a detailed overview of the configuration options.

2. Next to your username is a |image31| **Search Bar** providing you
   with a portal-wide search. This feature is described in detail in 
   `Global Search`_.

|image32|

.. centered:: Portal header

User Settings in the Axon.ivy Portal
------------------------------------

When you click on your username in the top right of the Axon.ivy Portal,
a menu is shown allowing you to configure the portal to your personal
needs. These features are described in the following sections below.

Absences
~~~~~~~~

The menu entry **Absences** provides you with an absence management
component. Here you can enter your absences and define delegates for
tasks assigned to you or one of the roles you hold.

.. hint::
   Although you can specify         
   delegates for a role you hold, we recommend specifying only delegates for tasks
   assigned personally to you. Roles are normally held by a group of users, so if
   you’re absent one of your role members is still able to pick up the task.

|image34|

.. centered:: Axon.ivy Portal absences

The dialog shows you all current and upcoming absences. You may show also past
absences by activating the option **Show absences in the past**. Furthermore,
you can edit or delete absences by using the |image35| **Edit** or |image36|
**Delete** action in the row of the respective absence.

HowTo: Add absence

Email settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The menu entry **Email settings** allows you to configure your
preferences related to standard email notifications send by the Axon.ivy
Engine.

.. hint:: 
   If configured by your company’s application, you might also be able to configure application specific email notifications.   
..

The :guilabel:`Email settings` dialog provides you with the following configuration options:

1. The option **For all applications** allows you to use one
   configuration for all applications. It is important to note, that in the
   background these settings will be applied to all available applications.

2. The option **For each application** separate allows you to provide
   individual settings for each available application.

3. The option **Email notification on task assignment** allows you to
   specify if you want to receive an instant notification when a task is
   assigned to you or one of the roles you hold.

4. The setting **Daily summary at** allows you to specify the weekdays
   when you receive a summary of all tasks assigned to you or one of
   your roles.

5. The option **Further emails from application** allows you to activate
   / deactivate further email notifications.

Language Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The menu entry **Language settings** allows you to specify your
preferred application language. The setting will affect all Axon.ivy
Portal pages and – if supported – your companies applications pages as
well. The following languages are currently supported in the Axon.ivy
Portal:

-  English

-  German

-  French

-  Spanish

.. hint:: 
   Your application needs to support
   the same language as the one     
   selected in this menu. Otherwise 
   the application specific content 
   will be shown in the standard    
   language of the application. E.g.
   if your application only supports
   English, but you select Spanish  
   as the portal language, your     
   application specific dialogs will
   still be shown in English.       

|image40|

.. centered:: Axon.ivy Portal language settings

Change Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The menu entry **Change password** allows you to set a new password.

|image41|

.. centered:: Axon.ivy Portal password change dialog

Info
~~~~

The menu entry **Info** provides you with detailed information about the
Axon.ivy Engine, the Axon.ivy Portal and your companies application. You
might be asked for this information in case you issue a support request.

|image42|

.. centered:: Axon.ivy Portal version information

Logout
~~~~~~

The menu entry **Logout** will terminate your session in the Axon.ivy
Portal. You’ll be routed back to the login page of the Axon.ivy
Portal.

.. hint:: 
   The Axon.ivy Portal will also do
   an automatic logout if you’re   
   inactive for a certain amount of
   time.                           
   
Global Search
-------------

   The :guilabel:`Global Search` is a convenient tool for you to look up
   information in the whole Axon.ivy Portal. You may search for any
   keyword. By default, the Axon.ivy Portal will search for:

1. Processes

2. Cases

3. Tasks

When you confirm the keyword you’re looking for, the Axon.ivy Portal
will route you to the :guilabel:`Global Search Results` page. For each category
a tab is provided, giving you the results of your search.

|image43|

.. centered:: Axon.ivy Portal global search result page

.. hint:: 
   Your company’s application may   
   provide further search           
   capabilities which are integrated
   in the Axon.ivy Portal Global    
   Search. You’d find the results on
   the result page accordingly.     
   Contact your administrator for   
   more information.                

Full Process List
*****************

The :guilabel:`Full Process List` page gives you an overview on all the
processes in the application that are accessible to you. You can reach
the page by either using the |image44| **Processes** link in the
Axon.ivy Portal menu or the quick link **Show all processes** in your
dashboard.

|image45|

.. centered:: Navigate to Full Process List

On the :guilabel:`Full Process List` page, you see a list of all processes. They
are sorted alphabetically and grouped by their initial character. An
exception are the :guilabel:`Express Workflows` which are grouped under an own
category Express Workflows. Express workflows are described in detail in `Axon.ivy Express`_.

|image46|

.. centered:: Axon.ivy Portal Full Process List page

If you’re looking for a specific process, you may use the |image47|
**Search** feature which is located on the right-hand side next to the
heading **Processes**. The search will look up your keyword in the
process names and filter the process list accordingly.

.. warning:: 
   Don’t confuse the process search
   with the global Axon.ivy Portal 
   search which you find in the    
   header area of the Portal.      

When you select a process from the list, a new case of this process is started.
Please be aware, that after you finished your activities in the case you will be
re-directed to the :guilabel:`Dashboard`  and not the :guilabel:`Full Process
List`.

.. hint:: 
   Starting processes from the Full Process List page is fine if you require
   this process only on a rare basis. For all processes which you use on a
   regular basis we highly recommend configuring them on your personal
   dashboard. See `HowTo: Add a process as a user favorite`_ for an instruction.
   
Full Task List
**************

The :guilabel:`Full Task List` page shows you the same tasks you see on your
personal dashboard. However, this page provides you with extended
information on the tasks, as well as, advanced search and filter
capabilities. You can reach the page by using the |image49| **Tasks**
link in the Axon.ivy Portal menu.

.. hint:: 
   Depending on the roles you hold
   in the application and the     
   configuration of the Axon.ivy  
   Portal, you might see not only 
   the tasks belonging to you but 
   all open tasks.                

|image50|

.. centered:: Navigate to Full Task List page

On the top of the **Full Task List** page you see next to the heading
**Tasks** in brackets the overall number of tasks shown to you. Further
to the right you find a |image51| search feature which you might use if
you’re looking for a specific task. Below you find the filter feature.
The usage will be explained in the HowTo’s further down this chapter.

For each task the following key information is shown in the list:

1. Priority

2. Name and Description

3. Responsible user or role

4. Task ID

5. Creation Date

6. Expiry Date

Finally, you have the possibility to access the full set of the task
data by using the |image53| **Show Details** button in the center of
each task column. You may hide them again using the |image54| **Hide
Details** button accordingly.

The task details are separated in 4 different sections:

1. On the left-hand side you find again the task description. In this
   format you can, however, see the whole description if it is longer.

2. On the center-left, you find various metadata concerning the task and
   the respective case it is related to.

3. On the center-right, you find an area for documents that were
   attached to the case. These documents once attached to the case are
   available on all tasks. You may add or delete documents which his
   described in the HowTo’s below.

4. On the right-hand side you find a notes area. The Axon.ivy Portal
   adds notes here when a task – for example – is delegated. You may add
   additional notes which is described below.
