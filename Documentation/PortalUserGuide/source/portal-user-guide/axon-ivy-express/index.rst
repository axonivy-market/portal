So far, this document familiarized you with the Axon.ivy Portal and
explained how you can use processes provided to you by your IT
department. The following chapter takes you to the next level.

:guilabel:`Axon.ivy Express`  is a module of the Axon.iy Digital Business
Platform which is provided to you with the Axon.ivy Portal as well. It
enables you – as a business user – to create your own process
applications and share them with your colleagues. These capabilities are
also known as No-Code Application Platforms or Citizen Developer
Platforms.Therefore, it is the perfect tool for you to digitize your
processes and create standardization, reliability and traceability. Some
of the key features of Axon.ivy Express are:

-  It is a **No Coding Toolset**, allowing business users to create
   processes without IT background.

-  The **Axon.ivy Portal Integration**, allows business users to
   implement processes without IT department involvement.

-  The **Seamless Integration** into the Axon.ivy Digital Business
   Platform allows you to make use of standard features like email
   notifications, task delegation, etc.

-  The **Powerful Toolset** allows you to create processes, define
   different task types, set responsibilities and due dates and define
   user dialogs for each task.

You can reach the page by either using the |magic-icon| **Processes** link
