The dashboard itself is separated in 3 sections:

   1. The :guilabel:`Processes`  section on the left side. Here you find and
      manage quick links to the processes you use most often in your daily work. The
      section Processes is described in detail `Process Favorites`_.

   2. The :guilabel:`Tasks`  section in the center. Here you see all the open tasks
      assigned to your or your organizational unit. These tasks require
      your personal attention. The section is described in detail `Personal Tasks`_.

   3. The :guilabel:`Statistics` section on the right side. The charts in this
      section provide you with basic information on the performance of your

Process Favorites
-----------------

The process favorites you find under the heading :guilabel:`Processes` on the
left side of your dashboard. They provide you with a quick and easy access to
the processes you need most in your daily work. Therefore, the process favorites
are a key feature to enhance your Axon.ivy Portal experience and increase your
efficiency. To make full use of this feature the Axon.ivy Portal offers you an
easy way to configure the process favorites to your personal needs. This is
described later in this chapter. 

|process-favorites|

.. centered::  Process favorites

When you have a look at the process favorites you see two areas:

-  On the top you find the :guilabel:`User Favorites` which you need to
   configure before you can use them. You may add processes here as well
   as external links.

-  Below you find the :guilabel:`Application Favorites`. They are centrally
   configured by your administrator. Therefore, you may use but not
   change them.

Furthermore, next to the heading you find a link :guilabel:`Show all processes`.
This quick link routes you the **Full Process List** page of the
Axon.ivy Portal. Please refer to :ref:`full-process-list` for more detail detailed information.

Personal Tasks

your dashboard. You see here all tasks that are assigned to you or any of the
roles you hold within the application. Therefore, this section is key in

from the task list and start working on it.

|personal-tasks|

.. centered:: Personal Tasks

At first glance, you see the number of tasks right next to the heading
:guilabel:`Tasks`. Further to the right you find the link **Show full task
list**. This quick link routes you to the :guilabel:`Task List` page of the
Axon.ivy Portal. Please refer to :ref:`full-task-list` for more
detailed information.

Right below the heading :guilabel:`Task` you find the following features which
support you in finding the correct tasks:

1. With the link Sort by priority you can sort the task list from the
   highest to the lowest priority.

2. With the link Sort by expiry time you can sort the task list
   according to the time left until the task expires.

3. On the right side of the Tasks section you find a search box. The
   Axon.ivy Portal searches for your keyword in the task ID, name and
   description of the tasks in your task list.

|personal-tasks-sort-and-search-features|

.. centered:: Personal tasks sort and search features

3. The :guilabel:`Task ID`

Next to the heading you find a link **Show all charts**. This quick link
routes you the :guilabel:`Statistics` page of the Axon.ivy Portal. Please refer
to :ref:`full-statistic-list`  for more detailed information.

Within the green header of the chart, you find two navigation buttons
(|pre-button|, |next-button|) allowing you to toggle between the available
charts. Each chart then provides you with the following information:

1. The :guilabel:`Chart Title` , helping you to understand the content of the
   chart

2. The :guilabel:`Chart` itself, which gives you a graphical representation of
   the data. Furthermore, you see the exact figures in the chart as
