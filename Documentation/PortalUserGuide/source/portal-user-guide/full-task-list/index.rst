Full Task List
**************

The :guilabel:`Full Task List` page shows you the same tasks you see on your
personal dashboard. However, this page provides you with extended
information on the tasks, as well as, advanced search and filter
capabilities. You can reach the page by using the |check-icon| **Tasks**
link in the Axon.ivy Portal menu.

.. hint:: 
   Depending on the roles you hold
   in the application and the     
   configuration of the Axon.ivy  
   Portal, you might see not only 
   the tasks belonging to you but 
   all open tasks.

   Task key information

Furthermore, at the end of each column you find a set of key features in
handling tasks:

1. Reset Task

2. Delegate Task

3. Open Task

4. Further actions

Finally, you have the possibility to access the full set of the task
data by using the |down-icon| **Show Details** button in the center of
each task column. You may hide them again using the |up-icon| **Hide
Details** button accordingly.

The task details are separated in 4 different sections:

1. On the left-hand side you find again the task description. In this
   format you can, however, see the whole description if it is longer.

2. On the center-left, you find various metadata concerning the task and
   the respective case it is related to.

3. On the center-right, you find an area for documents that were
   attached to the case. These documents once attached to the case are
   available on all tasks. You may add or delete documents which his
   described in the HowTo’s below.

4. On the right-hand side you find a notes area. The Axon.ivy Portal
   adds notes here when a task – for example – is delegated. You may add
   additional notes which is described below.
