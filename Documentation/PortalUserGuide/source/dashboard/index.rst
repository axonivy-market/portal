      section Processes is described in detail `Process Favorites`_.

   2. The :guilabel:`Tasks`  section in the center. Here you see all the open tasks
      assigned to your or your organizational unit. These tasks require
      your personal attention. The section is described in detail `Personal Tasks`_.

   3. The :guilabel:`Statistics` section on the right side. The charts in this
      section provide you with basic information on the performance of your
      cases and tasks. This section is described in detail in `Statistics`_.

Process Favorites
-----------------

The  **Process favorites** you find under the heading :guilabel:`Processes` on the
left side of your dashboard. They provide you with a quick and easy access to
the processes you need most in your daily work. Therefore, the process favorites
are a key feature to enhance your Axon.ivy Portal experience and increase your
efficiency. To make full use of this feature the Axon.ivy Portal offers you an
easy way to configure the process favorites to your personal needs. 

.. figure:: images/process-favorites.png

When you have a look at the process favorites you see two areas:

-  On the top you find the :guilabel:`User Favorites` which you need to
   configure before you can use them. You may add processes here as well
   as external links.

-  Below you find the :guilabel:`Application Favorites`. They are centrally
   configured by your administrator. Therefore, you may use but not
   change them.

Furthermore, next to the heading you find a link :guilabel:`Show all processes`.
This quick link routes you the **Full Process List** page of the
Axon.ivy Portal. Please refer to :ref:`full-process-list` for more detail information.

   description of the tasks in your task list.

   the data. Furthermore, you see the exact figures in the chart as
